MOORE'S BRITISH FERNS. With Coloured Plates. scU\\\" PREFACE. TuE object proposed in this volume is, in the first place, to present our young readers with a complete and systematic list of oui Britisli Birds : \\u2014 the word British being taken to mean such aSj being truly wild birds, either inhabit Britain throughout the year^ visit Britain statedly for longer or shorter periods of each year, or have been proved to reach the shores of Britain two or three times or oftener, under the pressure of any incidental circumstances whatever. In the next place, the attempt has been made to distmguisli at once between the rare or casual visitors, and such as are really denizens of the Land, whether for a few weeks or months aimualiy, or by unbroken habitation. But the principal object and intention of the book is to present Qoonooa PREFACE, accurate and trustworthy accounts of the Nests and Nesting-sites the Eggs, and any ascertained nesting or breeding-season peculiarities of every undoubtedly British-breeding species. And thb author's difficulty has often been out of the large mass of available materials at his command, acquired by personal observation or from the reading and notes of many years, to select what might be instructive, interesting or amusing, without bm-dening the book with unnecessary details, or encroachmg too much on the allotted space. The principle adopted in the illustrations has been to omit all representations of eggs either white or nearly white in colour-, in order to husband space for the admission ot a greater number of those characterised by varied colours and marldngs. On the same ground, although it was earnestly desired by the artist to give more than one representation of some of the very marked variations occurring in the eggs of several species, he has been compelled to content himself with selecting and figuring the most typical or normal forms in all such cases. AH the illustrations given have be^ carefully drawn from unquestionable specimens, and Mr. Coleman desires to acknowledge in this place the assistance, which in this matter, has been afforded him by that excellent and accurate practical naturalist, Mr. Y. Bond. PREFACE. VU An Appendix is subjoined, in wluch a notice will be found of the habits of nidification, the nests and eggs of several birds, which though regular inhabitants of Britain or soiiie part of it, for a given portion of each year, still retire to foreign and distant localities for the purposes of nest-making and rearing their young. Finally, an attempt has been made to exhibit at one glance, and iu a very condensed and systematic form, as much information as possible touching the nest, its customary site and materials, and also the eggs, their number, colour, and markings, and any noteworthy breeding peculiarities of each separate British-breeding species.. ] t is hoped this attempt, somewhat novel as it is, and almost inevitably imperfect as it must be in some respects, will not be regarded as altogether unacceptable by the youthful nest-hunter and egg-coUector. The author has only to obseiTc, in conclusion, that he has scarcely thought it necessary in the majority of instances to notice the common and well recognised fact that the particular species under notice, iu common with many or most of our common British Birds, rears two broods, or even more, in the course of the summer. Neither has he thought it requisite to attempt to PREFACE define the average season for the commencement of nidificatlon in the case of this or that species, as they came successively under review. INTRODUCTORY CHAPTERS. ClIAPTEE I. TuE object with wliich this book is written is tliat it may be interesting and useful to young egg-collectors. It is not easy to make a book, which is to be devoted to such details as the length and breadth and sliadcs and markings of some two or three hundred different eggs, eitlier interesting, or even barely readable. But there is no necessity that a book of British birds' eggs and nests should be devoted to merely such details as those. For my own part, 1 do not find it easy altogether to dissociate the eggs laid from tlie bird which lays them ; and when I see a beautiful nest, I can hardly help being led to think something about the builder, its means, objects, powers, instincts and intelligence. And I don't see why a book about eggs and nests should not follow the direction given by those same objects to my thoughts, and the thoughts of hundreds and thousands of other men besides me, and I am sui-e too ol hundreds and thousands of boys and girls as well. I am as sui-e as if I could see into the minds of many and many a young nest-hunter, that when he finds one day the wonderfully neat and beautiful Chaiiinch's or Goldfinch's or Crested Wren's nest, and the ncAt, lights upon some littering Jackdaw's nest, or B 2 BRITISH BIRDS, THEIR EGGS AND KES7S. inartistic, careless-seeming Jay's or E-iiig-dove's, that the wide, wonderful contrast and diiference sets him thinking \\u2014 What is the reason of this strange dissimilarity ? Is one of these birds really less clever than the other ? Did God make one of them a careless, disorderly, unthrifty bird, while the other He mado such a wonderfully neat and dexterous and contriving one ? And I am equally sure that a little measui-e of observation and thought wUl be enough to show the young inquirer not only that the Great Maker of Birds and Giver of their instincts and imderstandings and capacities has not left some of His creatures imperfect in some of their qualifications and endowments, but that the very contrasts and unlikenesses which first set liim on questioning at all, all teach one great lesson and illustrate one great truth, \\u2014 namely this, \\\" Lord, how manifold are Thy works ! In wisdom hast Thou made them all.\\\" Perhaps an Egg-book might be so written as to help such thought and observation as is here supposed, and now and then besides to suggest explanations or lead to investigation or commumcate a knowledge of facts such as to illustrate and make cleai, and even entertaining or amusing, the every day incidents and facts which fall commonly enough beneath the notice of the moderately sharp-eyed and observant nest-hunter. The difficulty of making such a book useful to the systematic collector of eggs, however yoimg, is not nearly as great as that of making it interesting to the many, who, tliough not inspired with the ambition of owning a real grand cabinet, and of arranging its manifold drawers with neatly ordered and ticketed egg-cards, are yet sensible of a real pleasure and enjoyment in noticing the nests and eggs of their numerous \\\"feathered friends,\\\" and identifying such as may chance to be less familiarly known than the majority of those met with under ordinary INTRODUCTORY CHAPTERS. 3 circumstances. Faithful description and accurate representation are clearly witliin oiu' reach, and such description and representa\\u00bb tion are sufficient in nineteen cases out of twenty for the purposes of identification in all instances of usual occurrence. The cases in which identification is difficult are of two or ibree kinds. Sometunes the difficulty arises from the near resemblance of the eggs laid by different allied species, sometimes rroni the wide discrepancies in the markings and especially in the sliadiugs or tints of eggs laid by the same species ; but much more frequently from the doubtful eggs being met with apart from the containing nests, or from want of proper or sufficiently accurate observation of the nests at the moment of discovery. The young egg-fancier should always recollect that the fashion and materials and site of the nest taken in connection with the eggs will almost always, with the aid of a tolerably accurate and well illustrated Book of Eggs, enable him to decide without hesitation as to the real owner of the nests and eggs in question ; while there are very many eggs, such as the Common Wren's, those of one or more of the Tom-tits, the Lesser Willow-Wren &c., of which specimens may be found so nearly resembling one another in shade and size and spots, that it requires a very nice and experienced eye to allot the several eggs to their certain origin. In such a case as this, recoui'se must be had to some kind and experienced Oologist. A few words on another subject. The author has been gravely taken to task by some of his conscientious friends, for delineating in one or two of his former books the pleasures and excitements of egg-hunting, or the satisfaction of trying to form a methodical collection. He has been more than once asked \\u2014 Do you really mean to encourage boys in robbing birds' nests ? Can fou defend such a practice from the charge of cruelty P 4 BRITISH BIRDS, THEIR EGGS AND MESTS. If I thought there was any real or necessary connection between a love of egg-hunting \\u2014 yes, and egg-collecting, too, \\u2014 and cruelt3', 1 would not say another word for it or about it. But I am sure that the real lover of birds and their nests and eggs is not the boy who is chargeable with those torn and ruined nests \\u2014 \\\" destroyed \\\" as they may well be styled \\u2014 which grieve one as he walks along tlie lanes and hedge sides. If the nest is taken, or rudely and roughly handled, or tlie eggs aU plundered, there is cruelty : for in the one case, the poor parent-birds are warned by their instinct, if not their intelligence, to forsake their treasured charge ; in the other, they suffer from pitiless robbery of what they most love. But if the parent bird be not rudely and repeatedly driven from her nest, \\u2014 if the nest be not pidled out of shape, or the containing bushes or environing shelter be not wilfully or carelessly disturbed \\u2014 if two or three eggs are still left for her to incubate, there is, so far as human observation can reach, no pain, or concern, or uneasiness, to the little owners from the abstraction of one egg or more, and, therefore, of course, no cruelty in the abstraction. The legitimate pursuit of sport in the stubbles and turnip fields, or on the open moor, does not differ more widely from the cruel proceedings of tlie cold-blooded, hard-hearted slaughterer of his dozens of Rock-birds (many of which are always left to die lingeringly and miserably), than the object or manner of action of the true lover of birds and their ways and nests tjid eggs, trom the rutliless destruction of every nest and its contents which may happen to be met with by some young loutish country savage. Again, a few words more, and this time about ciassificatiora. I should like, if such a course were profitable, or even practicable, to make just such a classification as an active, sharp-eyed^ observant, persevering nest-hunter would, %s it were, find ready- INTKOUUCTOia CllAl'TERS. 5 made for liiin, by the results of his rambles and investigations and discoveries ; tliat is to say, to group the birds and their ep;gs according to their frequent occinTence, their comparative, but still not positive, iufrequency, or their downriglit rarity. By this means, ana the subdivisions which would be suggested by an enumeration oi the most usual sites of the several nests, an interesting, and at least partially instructive as well as good, system of classification would be devised. But I am afraid such a system would not have much to recommend it, besides its novelty and interest and practical hints \\\" where to look for this bird's nest or the other's ; and how to look so as to find.\\\" One great disadvantage would be that such classification, so called, would have the effect of brealdng up groups which uatui-e lias put together. There is, generally speaking, what may be called a great family-likeness between the eggs of the various species of any given genus, or kind of birds. Take the Buntings, for instance : any one who is familiar with the common YeUow-Hammer's egg would at once guess at the eggs of either of the other species as belonging to a Bunting ; and the same of the Titmice, Linnets, Thrushes, Crows, and so on without end. So that although it may seem at first sight that scientific classification is hard and troublesome and half umiecessary, and may often prompt the question in the boy-collector's mind. Why wouldn't it do just as well to write down the English names on the cards and in my catalogue, and arrange them all my own way ? still it should be remembered that such classification after all is far from arbitrary, and on the contrary, and as far as it is really good, only follows out the teachings or guidings of nature. And this quite independently of the trouble which is saved by it to any one who wishes to consult books of reference, and still more to examine large and well-arranged collections of eggs, whether 6 BRITISH BIRDS, TUEIR EGGS A.ND NESTS. for his own direct instruction, or merely in searcii of interesting pastime. If a boy only knows that a Reed-Sparrow is called a Reed-Sparrow or a Black-headed Bunting, and he wanted to find the Reed-sparrow's eggs in a well-stocked collection, he might be half-an-hour before he lit upon what he wanted ; but if he knew that the generic name of the Bunting was Emberiza, and the specific name of the Reed-Sparrow, Schoeniclus, he would be able to pitch upon his quarry in half-a-minute. Besides all which, no one was ever the worse for learning habits of orderly and systematic arrangement, even though he had to pay the price of doing a little puzzling head-achy work, and liad to bother himself with a good many ugly-looking, ill-souuding, jaw-cracking words, such as Coccothraustes, Troglodytes, Platyrhynca, Phalacrocorax, and the like. It is proposed in this little book to adopt a classification which seems to meet with very general acceptance or acquiescence, and principally for that reason ; \\u2014 that, namely, which was employed by the late Mr. TarreU. This classification depends on the system which divides all birds whatever into five great classes, viz : \\u2014 I. Raptores Prey-catchers. II. Insessores Perchers. III. Rasores Scratciiers. IV. Grallatores .... Waders, V. Natatores .... Swimmers. Kach of these classes, or \\\"Orders,\\\" as they are technically called, is again divided either into distinct Pamilies, or (at least in some cases) into Sub-classes, or Groups ; these Groups being then further subdivided into Famihcs. Again, these Families are made up of more or fewer genera, and each genus of more or INTRODUCTORY ClIAPTJiRS. 7 Tewer species. These species, so many of tliem as compose any particular genus, all differ from one another more or less, but yet have a strong general resemblance, or (what may familiarly be called) strong family likeness to each other. The general scheme or, as I may almost call it, the skeleton o\\u00a3 our classification will therefore stand thus : \\u2014 ORDER I.\\u2014 R^\\\\rTORES. Family I. Vulluridce'^ . . . Vulture-kind.

The true or real meaning of any one of them would be, that the l)irds in the Family so named are the children, or descendants, of the bird or birds whose name is used\\u2014 thus, Vulturidoe, sous of a Vulture or Vultures\\u2014 which, of course, is nonsense, as the words are applied.

This I have tried to convev in the annexed translation. It ouj,'ht to be observed also that the Bird whose name is given to the entire Family is selected for such purpose as possessing the characteristic qualities or peculiarities of the family in question, or, at least, most of them, in the strongest and most marked degree. t SylviadcB I have translated Wood-bird-kind, because Sylvia means something connected with wood, if it means anything. Sylvia is taken, in Bird-nomenclature, to denote a Warbler; and it may be said, that most of those birds whLch come under this division are Warblers in some sense, and are. in some degree or other, of sylvan habits; at least if wo give to tha word sylvan some latitude of meaning.

CHAPTEll 11. Any one who is conversant with Yarrell's admirable \\\" British Bu-ds,\\\" will most likely have noticed that that author givea in almost every case very precise measurements of the eggs of each particular species of Bird described. And it might, at first sight, seem to be so necessary to give such measurements that one would very likely feci half inclined to pronounce a Book of Birds' Eggs very imperfect, whicii omitted all notice of dimensions. But tlic fact is, such measurements are, in so very many different instances, altogether fallacious and likely to mislead. Thus I.Ir. Yai-rell's measurements of the Blackbird's egg are, \\\" the lengtli one incli, two lines ; the breadth ten lines.\\\" That is no doubt a good average or approximate measurement, but I have Blackbirds' eggs before me wliicli vary between half a line, or -^^ of an inch, less, and a line, or ^\\\\ of an incii, more in length, and between half a line, more or less, in breadth. Again, I have two Starlings' eggs on my table, both taken from the same Pigeon-cote, in Essex; one of which is l-^^s iiicli long by |\\u00a7 inch broad; the other 1-^ inch long, and fg inch broad; while to tlie eye the latter is not much more than half as large as the former. Moreover, Mr. Yarrell's measurements for this bird's eggs are precisely the same as for those of the Blackbird, and not only not tallying with those of either of my eggs, but not even presenting a near approach to the medium dimensions. Great numbers of similar instances might be adduced, and 12 BRITISH lilKDS, TIIKIK EGGS AND NESTS. in connection with tlic very commonest birds. Even eggs irom tne same nest may continually be met with, presenting great disparity in bulK ; one in the number being frequently so small in comparison with the others as to set one invariably thinking it must have been the last laid, and that a partial failure ol egg-producing power in the mother-bird must be the explanatioa of the phenomenon. It seems scarcely open to question that the physical condition of the parent-bird must exercise a great influence over its eggproducing capacity. Its powers may be impaired by age, by the past effects of injury or sickness, by a partial failure of some necessary element of food, by undue pressure on the egg-producing organs, such as m'lst occur by the loss of one or more early layings. Indeed all these causes are well-known to interfere with the reproductive energies of animals at large, and it is a thorouglily ascertained fact that both the first and the last act most strongly in the case of many Birds. The comparative size of Bii'ds' eggs, therefore, seems to me a matter to which it is unnecessary, if not inexpedient, to direct the young collector's attention; in any other way at least, than as to a matter of curious observation and contrast. As a means of identification it fails completely, and is only adverted to here for the purpose ol obviating a portion of the perplexity which may often occur in practice to the youthful egg-fancier from the difference in size between different specimens of what are in reality eggs of the same species of birds, but seem to him, from their discrepaucj of dimensions, not possibly so. Again, the colour and markings of many different species of eggs are found to admit of great variation. The most familiar and striking instance is in the case of the Guillemot: but one more within the reach of every nest-hunter is presented by tiie I.N'TEODUCTORY CnAPTERS. 13 eggs of the Blackbird. Sometimes the spots on them are verj minute and multitudinous ; almost confluent from their number and minuteness ; sometimes large and well defined and permitting the ground-shade of the shell to be very apparent ; sometimes reddisli in colour, closely approaeliing the shade of those on the Ring-Ousel's egg, and sometimes brown in hue, with no reddish tinge at all ; and sometimes they disappear altogether, or very nearly, and leave the egg with a strong resemblance to the littlftspotted Thrush's egg.* To such an extent is this the case, that a year or two since I was misled into assuming that four eggs which I found in a nest with all the characters of a Blackbird's nest, must most certainly from their colour and markings, be assigned to a Thrush original and not to a Blackbird. Other familiar instances of the same kind may be noticed as met with in the eggs of the House-Sparrow, tlie Tree-Pipit, tlie Sky-Lark, the Yellow-Haramer, one or more of the Hawks, &c. In the fabric and materials of nests, again, as constructed by birds of tlie same species, much dissimilarity, under peculiar circumstances, will be found to prevail. But really not more than might have been looked for beforehand, if it were not that, in our asual way of thinking about birds and other animals, we lay so much stress upon Instinct, and do not so mucli as admit t>D our notice the possibility that many of their actions may be prompted by a measure of intelligcncp, and not simply an unconsidering, unreasoning influence, which we term their Instinctive endowment. No doubt Instinct teaches them both to buUd and how to build their nests, and what materials are the most suitable, and the sites that are most eligible. But it is scarcely Instinct which sets the Eagle and the Crow, wflen tneir abode ia in a place that does not furnish the sticks they commonly \\u2022 i'arrell, i. 201. Ilewitson, L C3. 14 BRITISH BIRDS, TKEIR EGGS AND NESTS, or instinctively use for building their nests, to adopt instead of sticks the sea-weed stems which their home does produce. And so too of the House-Sparrow, which builds a huge domed or well covered-in nest, if it selects a tree or ivy for its site, but only lines the bottom of the hole in thatch, or a wall, with abundant feathers or hair or straw. The Wren, again, which usually builds its nest so that it may easily be removed entii'e and compact, may be found to avail itself of such a site for its nest, that it may be built on the principle of application \\u2014 like the Martin's to the wall beneath the eaves \\u2014 so that, when taken from its site, it shall appear to have had a segment completely cut out or sliced oiT from it. The adaptation of materials to site also, so as to secure a greater degree of concealment by making the intrusive structure assimilate in external fabric and hue to tlie surrounding objects, is well worthy of noticing attention, as supplying not only fresh sources of seeming unlikeness in nests of the same species of birds, but also fresh instances of the little feathered architect's wonderful adaptive iuteUigeuce. The question, \\u2014 Why are Birds' Eggs, iu so many cases, so variously and beautifully ornamented? Why are their hues and markmgs made so attractive to look at ? has ofteu been asked, and two or tliree difi'ereut answers or modes of answer have been suggested. I have seen the idea started that the design of such various colouring and marking is intended to facilitate concealment, by the adaptation of the general hue of the egg to that of the recipient or supporting substances. The theoiy is at least original and amusing ; but unfortunately less happy than when applied to the plumage of the bu-ds themselves which lay the eggs. It is no easy thing to detect a Partridge as she sits, lifeless-seeming, amid other objects not more still than herself. INTRODUCTORY CUAFTERS. 15 and presenting no great contrast in colour to her feathers : but there is no difficulty in seeing her eggs as they lie in the nest. And so well aware is she of the fact, that she always covers her eggs with some convenient and suit able material \\u2014 last year's oak leaves, for example \\u2014 when leaving her nest deliberately, or not under the impulses of alarm. The Hedge-Sparrow's eggs again, or any other blue egg, how can they be supposed to become less conspicuous by their colour when reposing in some earth-brown or hay-coloured nest-cup ? If it had been said that the Golden Plover's eggs, the Peewit's, tne Snipe's, the Norfolk Plover's \\u2014 not to name many others of which the same might be alleged \\u2014 were of such general hue, so shaded and so marked as to be anything but conspicuous, as to be indeed well calculated to escape any but a most scrutinising notice, in the apologies for nests which usually contain them, the entire truth of the remark would have appealed to every nest-finder's experience and assent : but it will not do so in any other form. It is impossible to lay down any rule for the coloui-s of eggs in connection with the places, or nature of the places, in which they are laid. \\\"White eggs are not laid in nests buUt in dark holes as a rule \\u2014 indeed, very much the contrary ; witness the Dove's eggs, and so many of those of the Duck tribe; nor are dark-colom-cd eggs invariably found to be laid where exposed to the greatest amount of broad dayliglit. There seems to be no rule in the matter. Again, another answer to the question just noticed is, Eggs were made so beautiful, and so vatious in their beauty, to gratify and gladden man's eye. I don't dispute the fact that the beautiful shape, and the beautiful tints, and the beautiful markings do gratify and gladden the human ey< and human heart too. I 16 BlUTISII BIKD8, TIIEIK EGGS AND NESTS. kuou they do, and in thousands of cases, and with a great, pure pleasure. But that is a very different thing from saying tlial God made them so for no other reason, or even for that purpose as a principal reason. How many thousands of eggs, for ten that are seen by man, escape all human notice whatever ! How many millions upon millions in the old-world times before there were men to see them, must have had their fair colours, and delicate synmietry, and harmonious interminglmg of hues, for no purpose whatever according to this view ! No, no. Nature siiould not be read so. God made tJie Beasts of the Field, and the Birds of tlie Air, and the Fishes of the Sea, and the Insects, and the Shells, and the Trees, and Herbs, and Flowers, ail, as a rule, wonderfully, gloriously, harmoniously beautiful, because He is a God of order, and beauty, and harmony ; because it would liave been inconsistent with His own Being, with the necessary purposes of such a Being, with the declared objects of such a Being in Creation, TiOt to have made all \\\" very good ;\\\" and the same reason which accounts for the beauty of tlie myriad flowers \\\" born to blush unseen,\\\" for that of the imiumerable shells and insects of past days and the present day, for that of the glorious birds of Tropic lands, is all that we want in the way of explanation of the symmetry and beauty of the Bird's Egg \\u2014 God made it as well as all other things \\\" very good.\\\" Something more to the point for the practical egg-hunter, and even although he may be not very juvenile, is to recommend the practice of jotting do-s\\\\Ti notes of any peculiarity of either nest or eggs or behaviour of parent birds, in any supposable case a little unusual. Such notes are always interesting and very often useful at some long subsequent period; useful in themselves, and useful too as commenting on or else illustrated by, the sinular memoranda of other observers. Besides, what is put down upon IXTKODUCTOKY CHAPTERS. 17 paper while the incident is still fresh, and the memory of it not Interfered with by other and newer matters of strong interest, the record is sme to be accurate ; wlule mere recollection at a later date is about sure to be insufficient or untrustworthy. Perhaps the boy-collector too may not thuik a few sentences about blowing and drying and mounting his egg-treasures either tiresome or uunecessary. As a niJe, let the egg intended to be kept be blown and dried as soon as possible. There are several reasons for tliis piece of advice. The light shells travel more safely than the full ef;g;; the egg-shells do not suffer detriment from lying overlooked with their contents rotting within, as often happens with the collector of un-careful and un-precise habits ; they are put into a state of comparative readiness for prompt and complete preparation and arrangement ; and though last not least, a good, useful, methodical habit is eucouraged in the collector himself. There are several ways of blowing an egg and going tlirougb the preparatory stages of fitting it to take its place m a collection. There are also instruments for extracting the contents of the shell so as to obviate the necessity of makiug more than one hole. I don't think they are likely to be of much use to a mere boy. 1 am sure they would be a great deal of trouble, and I don't think that the end gained would repay the trouble and care expended, I have always found a small hole, only just large enough to admit the passage of sufficient air to expel the contents, made very carefully and neatly at the small end, and a larger one about half-way between the great end and the line of greatest diameter, which need not be more than a line in breadth for the very largest eggs (if not \\\"hard-sat,\\\") quite sufficient for my purpose, and not objectionable on the score of disfiguring the shell ; for by mounting the egg with the larger or vent hole, downwards \\u2014 the smaller hole being 18 bhitisu birds, tiieui eggs and nests. practically invisible in a great number of instances, at least until looked for \\u2014 it appears to be altogether entire and perfect. Any tolerably strong pin will da for the purpose with small eggs. For the larger and harder shells something more efficient win be required. A hard steel instrument fashioned like a \\\" glo \\u25a0 ver's needle\\\" \\u2014 that is with the penetrating end furnished with three edges all lost in the point \\u2014 is as good as any thing that could be devised, and by liaving two or three of different sizes, every case of necessity would bo provided for. The sharp-pointed pen-blade may be employed, but great care is necessary lest, when the perforation is just effected, the instrument slip a little further in than was intended, and an ugly fragment of shell be wrenched out. When the e^g is thoroughly blown, it is advisable to draw up a little clean water into it by the process of immersing tlie vent hole and sucking or drawing in the air from the shell with the mouth through the other\\u2014 just reversing the late process of \\\" blowing\\\" in sliort. The shell, when half-full, should be weh shaken, and the water then expelled as the legitimate contents had been : a very gentle puff will suffice for this. Hepeat the process two or three times, or until the water comes out as clear as it went in ; then dry the egg as weU as you can by blowing through it at intervals, after it has been so held that the moisture on the inside may all trickle down towards the vent-hole ; after which it may be set up for some hours in an airy, but not sunny, place to dry thoroughly. Some collectors varnish their eggs. A little of the white of the egg itself is all-sufficient, and that should not be applied unless the egg is perfectly clean, which is by no means the case with the eggs of many groundbuilding birds when taken from the nest. I have taken Dabchicks' eggs also so completely muddied all over, that it was IXTRCD'JCTOKY C HATTERS. I'J slmost impossible to get tliem clean. One, met with on one of (he Efesex marshes a year or two since, which was the only one yet laid and apparently not a day old, was so engrained with dirt or mud that it defied all efforts to restore it to its pristine whiteness. In tlie case of an originally white egg, such clTorts will not do much liarm ; in the case of an egg strongly mai-ke.d with deep colours, it is a different matter. The eflorts to remove the clay or dirt imparted by the feet of the parent bird may succeed in removing the stains in question, but mny also very likely remove some of the tmts or stronger colouring too. It must be rem.embered that the deeper colours of many eggs are not \\\" fast,\\\" at all events when they have not been long laid, and that attempts at cleansing, more vigorous than judicious, may easDy produce an undesired result. If the vent-hole is necessarily made large, there is no objection to placing a piece of thin or gauze paper, wetted with the varnish or white of the egg, so as to cover the entire orifice, and so exclude dust or other intrusive substances. As to mounting the eggs, and labelling for insertion in the collection, much depends on taste. An ordiimry \\\"printer's\\\" card is as good for the purpose as anything, and a little very strong gum-water is the only other requisite. A little attention to placmg the eggs symmetrically and neatly, and the use of a few gun- wads or halfpence or small wooden wedges, to retain the eggs, when accurately set in their true position, until the gum has had time to narden, are matters which will almost sm-ely suggest themselves to any youthful egg-fancier Avho is only tolerably given to admire the \\\"simplex mimditiis.\\\" As for labels, they may either be neatly written, or procured, at a very light cost, printed on pui-posa lor such application. BRITISH BIRDS THEIR EGGS AND NESTS. la the following pages I shall endeavour, as far as my subject will permit, to avoid mere dry aad uninteresting detail. It is, of course, quite inconsistent with the nature of tiie book to omit matter-of-fact descriptions altogether, or even in any very great degree; but an effort will be made to relieve the whole from wearing the appearance of a catalogue in disguise, and to give it as much of a life-like practical character as possible. How many incidents in a school-boy's life are connected, in his memory, with some nesting expedition, some recollection of, perhaps, an accidental discovery of a nest and eggs he had never seen before, or possibly wished and tried to find, but always wished and tried in vain. Such experiences are always pleasant and interesting in their detail to the real lover of birds and their belongings ; and often almost as much so when detailed by others as when reproduced in his own recollections of former days, and their Hopes, and plans, and successes, and disappointments, each often renewed, or often repeated under some rarying from. Why, then, should not such matters stand here and there in these pages? Our plan, therefore, will be to omit all special notice of the 22 BUITISII BIJLDS. TUEIR EGGS AND NhSTS. nests and eggs of so-called \\\"British BLi-ds,\\\" whose only claim to the designation lies in their having been met with once or twice or even some half-dozen times in the British Isles : to omit it, that is, in the body of the book, and to give such reference or description of at least the more interesting species and their eggs, as space may allow, in an Appendix. Accounts will be, however, given of the liabits of nidification and the eggs of all unquestionably British Birds, even although their breeding habitat be in another country, or most rarely and exceptionally within the compass of the British seas \\u2022 such birds, for instance, as the Fieldfare, the lledwing, the Snow-Bunting, and others, besides several of the Ancdidx. We begin, therefore, with our first Order, the \\u2014 RAPTOKES. FAMILY I.\\u2014 VULTUEID^. Two members of this Pamiiy, classed by some naturaUsts as belonging to the same genus, by others as species of two different genera, have been met with in Britain; but I believe one of them, the first-named below, only once, the other only twice or three times. They are only mentioned here as showing the justification there is for claiming the family of Vulturidx as being in anywise exemplified in birds belonging to the Britisb Isles. 1. GRIFFON VULTURE\\u2014 (r\\u00ab/^Kr/\\u00ab/r\\u00abi). 2. EGYPTIAN VULTURE\\u2014 (iVeo;5^ro\\u00ab percnopierus). FAMILY II.\\u2014 FALCONID.E. There are several species belongmg to tiiis Family of sufficiently common occurrence even still in these days of ganieprescrvcrs, ganie-kecpers, and vermin-killers. GOLDEN EAGLE. 23 Time was, and not so long since either, uhen many even of those most rare now, wore familiarly met with in almost all parts of the country; and Eagles and the Kite and several of the larger and more conspicuous Falcons and Hawks were not yet become so much like Black Swans, as they are now in so many English and even Scottish counties. Tliese birds diCfer, with a marked distinction, from those belonging to the Yulture-kind ; and as much in habits and food and power of whig as in appearance, formation, bill and claws, and other matters, such as the scientific naturalist notices for the purpose of enabling liimself and others to distinguish between Family and Family, genus and genus, species and species Thus, tlie Vulture's food is usually carrion ; the flesh of animals killed by other agency than their own, and in numberless instances in a state of putridity more or less complete. The food of tlie Falcon tribe generally consists of the flesh of creatures taken and killed by themselves. I say generally ; \\u2014 not invariably. The Eagles in a state of nature do not disdain to gorge themselves on the flesh of a dead sheep for instance, although they have had no hand \\u2014 or rather beak and claw \\u2014 in the death. StiU the rule is, and admitting not many exceptions when the whole family is considered, that the Falconidse hunt for, or surprise, and slay their prey for themselves. And very intent on this business are they oftentimes, when engaged in discussing the meal their craft or stiU vigilance, or fierce impetuous speed and dash has secured for them. Often, too, not a little sleepy and heavy are they after having been lucky enough to secure a large prey, and greedy enough to stuff themselves fuU with it. The bird which stands at the head of the family and alike deserves and does credit to his rank is the 24 IJKniSll lURDS, TIIEIU KbGS AM) NEMS. 3. GOLDEN EAGLE\\u2014 (Jfjmla ehrysaetos). It seems almost too tame to talk of an \\\" Eagle's nest,\\\" and we seem almost to feel as if different M'ords might well be applied to the nursery-structure of the King of Birds, and that of the tiny Tom-tit or the \\\"VYren. So, independently of the nice, simple, old meaning of the word eyry * which makes it so suitable as anrilied to the egg-liome of the grand kingly bii-ds, called Eagles, we feel a sort of satisfaction in limiting the use of the word eyry to the Eagle's nest alone. No easy matter is it always to cmtivate a visiting acquaintance with an Eagle. His home is not in a place easy of access to any but himself, or those, like himself, up-borne on wings. On rock platforms, not too scanty in size, in mountaLnous districts, and guarded by rugged, stern, precipitous rock-walls, utterly forbidding, in almost every case, access by human members from below, and not often to be safely reached from above, the great pile which forms the nest is usually built. Sometimes, but very rarely by comparison, it may be found on some large, possibly shattered, forest-trunk amid some wild, seldom-approached scene of loneliness or desolation. It is four to five feet in diameter, made of sticks of no mean size and length, sometimes lined with softer materials, sometimes not ; the new or more recently constructed nest placed upon those of last yeyr and other preceding years ; and would require a willing and able labourer to clear it thoroughly away, and no slight touch of the quality of the gate-bearing Jewish hero in the juvenile nestseeker who might aspire to carry off such a trophy of Jiis nesting \\u2022 Probably from Saxon Eghe (g soundod like y) an egg. The moder'n English form of tlie word would be \\\" Egirery \\\" tlierefore ; the old English form Eyry or Eyrie. Chauoei (about 1400) wrote ey for egg. GOLDEX EAGLE. 23 exploits. The site chosen for tlie nest-pile too is ahiiost inv;iri. ably one which commands a wide, unliindered look-out ; partly it is likely, under the influence of the strong instinct of vigilance in self-prcsorvation, partly also for the advantages offered by such a dwelling-place towards the detection of a distant prey. The number of eggs deposited is usually two, sometimes three. They are commonly of a dull whitish ground, mottled or marbled nearly or quite all over with a sort of rusty hue. The young ones, while yet too young to leave the nest, are amply catered for by their parents. Lists are sometimes given of the spoils, feathered and four-footed, found m what may be styled the Eagle's larder \\u2014 Black Game, Moor Game, Partridges, Hares, Rabbits, Lambs, young Roes, and so on, to an amount that would seem hardly credible to one not conversant with the Eagle's power of vision and mighty sweep of wing. Indeed there is a story told of a man in L-eland who got a fair provision for his family in a season of scarcity by no other effort than was requisite in plundering an Eagle's nest of the food brought in by the parent birds for their young. He is said also to have prolonged the season of supply by preventing the young ones from flying, by clipping their wings as the feathers grew. Instances have oeen known where the prey seized was human. Professor Wilson tells a touching story, in a touching way, of an incident of the kind, in which the infant was seized as it lay and slept where its mother had placed it, while herself busy not far off in the harvest field, and carried off by the strong bird to its eyry. Tlie poor mother, frantic with her loss, blind to everything but tiie thought and effort for the recovery of her babe, safely scaled the precipice, liigh up on which the nest was placed; though no man, however skilful and expert as a cragsman, h.ad ever dared altemct the ascent ; found her babe 2'> iSUlTISII BIRDS, TIIEIB EGGS AND NESTS. alive and unhurt and smiling in her face, descended again \\u2014 a iiore perilous feat stUl \\u2014 in safety, and ouce more on level ground at the foot, swooned helplessly away. The Eagles did not attack her in reality, though their fierce menaces made the spectators tremble. Our boy readers if ever they found an Eagle's nest might well need the protection of a good strong cudgel, fearlessly and skilfully wielded, before they succeeded in possessmg themselves of one of its eggs. \\u2014 Fi^. 1, plate I. 4. WHITE-TAILED EAGLE.\\u2014 (ZTa/we^a* albicilla). Cidled also Erne, Cinereous Eagle, Sea Eagle. \\u2014 This species \\u2014 a member of another genus, however \\u2014 like the last, breeds amid high, almost inaccessible rocks, in the mountainous solitudes of Scotland, and some of the northernmost British Islands. The nest resembles the Golden Eagle's, but is often more cushioned \\u2014 one can hardly say lined, when there is scarcely any cavity or depression to receive the eggs \\u2014 more cushioned with soft material such as heather or sea-weed. This Eagle seldom lays more than two eggs, which in ground-colour are Like the Golden Eagle's, but not often noticeably marked with red- The White-tailed Eagle is much more frequently seen south of the Border than the Golden Eagle. In fact, a year rarely passes without some record of the occurrence of this fine bu-d in more than one county of England, and those by no means always the most northerly. On the rabbit waiTcns of Norfolk and Suifolk they are frequently met with, and it not seldom happens that two are seen together \\u2014 perhaps the young from the same nest driven forth by their stern parents to seek then- ovra. living in the wide worla. The male Eagle of this species is kiiowc, like the male of many 97 otner kinds of birds, to take his turn with his mate in incubating their eggs. It ^ouJd seem difficult for the observer to be mistaken iu this fact ; for the male bii-d, as is the case in the other families of the Falconidse generally, is very distinctly smaller than the female \\u2014 to the actual extent indeed of not niucn less than one-third cf the entii'e size. 5. SPOTTED EA.GL'E\\u2014iJquila ncevia). Met with in Britain, once or twice only. We come next to a Raptorial Bird, whose food is proouied mainly from the water, \\u2014 namely, the G. OSPREY \\u2014 (Pandlon halixeius). The Osprey, or Fisliing Hawk, or Mullet Hawk, or Eagle Fisher, * builds its nest sometimes on a tree, sometimes on some part of an ancient and deserted building \\u2014 always on the liighest part, a turret or chimney for instance \\u2014 and sometimes on a rock or precipitous scar. But a very favourite and almost characteristic site \\u2014 speaking of the bird only as a British bird \\u2014 is oa some lone insular rock in a wild mountain loch in Scotland. I extract a very striking description from \\\" St. John's Tour in Sutherland : \\\" \\\" The nest was placed in a most curious situation. About a hundred and fifty yards from the shore, there rose from the deep water a solitary rock, about ten feet high, shaped like a broken sugar-loaf or truncated cone. On the summit of this was the nest, a pile of sticks of very great depth, evidently the accumulation of many breeding seasons, as the Osprey returns year after year to the same nest. How this heap of sticks witbutood the winter gales without being blown at once into the water puzzled me. * * * The female Osprey allowed our boat to approach within two hundred yards or so, and thee \\u2022 A translation of the Gaelic uarae of the bird. 28 BKJTlSIi lilKDS, TlIEIll EGGS AND XKSTS. leaving her nest, sailed upwards with a circling flight, till she joined her mate high above U3. Having reached the rock, and with some difficulty ascended to the nest, our disappointment may be imagined when we found it empty. From the old bird having remained on so long, we had made sure of finding eggs in it. Tlie nest itself, however, was interesting to me, perched as it was on the very summit o'f tlie rock, and composed of large sticks, * every one of which must have been a heavy burden for a bird of the size of the Osprey. In the centre of the pile of sticks was a cup-shaped hoUow, the size of a boy's cap, lined with moss and dead grass, and apparently quite ready to rect-ive eggs.\\\" \\\"In another nest,\\\" says the same author, elsewhere, \\\"we found two beautiful eggs, of a roundisn shape : the colour white, with numerc^us spots and marks of a fine rich red brown.\\\" \\u2014 Fig. 2, 'plate I. The Osprey is met with from time to time in almost all parts of the kingdom, but more especially along the east coast ; but it is known to breed nowhere in England now. In America, it is met with in considerable numbers, forming as it were a large colony, during the breeding season; of course, in the vicinity of some ample and convenient fishing station. We come next to the Falcons, distinguished from the rest of the Hawks, by, among otlier things, their long and pointed wings, and their vehement and lapid HigLt and dash in pursuing and seizing their quarry. Fu'st we notice the 7. GYR FALCON.\\u2014 (i^a/co Grmnlandicus). Also called Jer Falcon and Greenland Falcon. \\u2022 Some of the sticks \\u2014 or rather branches\\u2014 employed, are said to be \\\\\\\\ inch in diameter. PEREGRINE FALCON. 29 8. ICELAND FALCON.\\u2014 (/a/co Islandlcus). Neither of these birds breed in Britain, and they are only occasional and somewhat rare visitants. Whatever notice can be afforded to them, will be met with in the Appendix. 9. PEREGRINE FAI.CON. {Falco perejrinus). There was a tin)e at which this bird was abundant enough in our island. It still breeds in many parts of both England and Scotland, though much more commonly in the latter country. But in the feudal times there would have been no difficulty to the young egg-collector \\u2014 if such beings existed then \\u2014 in meeting with the nest of the Peregrine, in districts suitable to their breeding habits and requirements. Although some consideration, it is true, might have been advisable previously to appropriating the contents of the said nest for cabinet purposes. The right iiand of the fortunate collector would have been the penalty in lliose days of strict game laws. So stringent, indeed, were the provisions for preserving the Peregrine, that the customary breeding haunt of a pair was placed under the especial care of the occupiers of the land in the immediate vicinity, and they were made responsible, by the terms of their tenure, for the safe keeping of the noble birds and their offspring. One such site is in Goathlaud, on the line of the Pickering and Whitby Railway, and it is an interesting fact in the nesting habits of the Peregrine, that until within a recent period (and it is believed at the present time also), KiHuig-nab Scar has always been a site of that Falcon's nidification. Many of its breeding places, perhaps Uke others in the interior, known time out of mind by some name derived from the circumstance of their being thus appropriated, such as Faicon-scar, Hawk-scar, Eagle-cliff, are among the tallest and least accessible rocks of the sea coast. The nest itself is placed on rome projection, possibly within some fissure, and is so BRITISH BIRDS, THEIR EGGS AND NESTS. made of sticks, or seaweed from the coast, and is lined with soinft hail- on whicii, for the hoUow is not deep, the eggs repose. These are from two to four in number, often vary a good deal in size (probably according to the age of the laying bird), and not less in the markings and mottlings whicli pervade the entire sui'face. A reference to the engraving will give a better idea of the colour and appearance of this beautiful egg, than any description. Indeed, description of many \\u2014 of most \\u2014 eggs fails altogether iu conveying an adequate idea of what they are like. These birds were so much prized in the middle ages on account of their fitness for the highly-esteemed pursuit of Falconry; and their power of wing and magnificent flight are in themselves matters of great interest, quite independently of the excitement of the chase. The female, from her much greater size and strength, was emphatically \\\"the Falcon;\\\" the male, called the Tercel, or Tiercel, being more frequently flown at much smaller game, as Partridges. A Falcon-flight \\u2014 although the science is no longer ciiltivatcd at Didlington, in Norfolk, as it was a few years since by the late owner of the estate \\u2014 may still, however, be seen, from time to time, by the fortunately-placed observer, both Hawk and quarry being ferae naturd. Some luckless GuU, or Guillemot, or Rock-Dove, is selected by the strong freebooter and carried off from amid the passing multitudes with a fierce, rushing dash ; and if there are young to be sustained, the onset aad sweep may possibly be seen once and again. \\u2014 Fig. 3, plate I. 10. l\\\\O^V>X\\u2014{Falco subbuteo.)

It lays two or three (very rarely four) eggs, beautiful, as all the Falcons' eggs are, and leaving no doubt as to tlieir Falcon original to a:iy one who is able to tell even \\\" a Hawk from a Heronsheugh.\\\" They are of a nearly uniform pale dull red in ground-colour, thickly spotted and mottled with shades of deeper red.

Also Stone-Falcon, Blue Hawk. \\u2014 This beautiful bird makes its nest, in moor-land districts at least, almost invariably on the ground ; though it is rather a piece of flattery to say that it makes a nest at aU. A little hollow iu the ground, and that usually not too conspicuous by the absence of ling in its vicinity, with scarcely any lining, receives the eggs, three to five in number, and characterised by the reddish hue and spottings which seem to garnish the eggs of almost all the true Falcons. The nest is said to be sometimes built in a tree, and then, from l&r. Doubleday's account, seems to be made of sticks, and lined with wool. The Merlin, or Blue Hawk as he is usually called here, IS not a rare bu'd on our North Riding moors ; and a very bold and active Hawk it is. \\u2014 Fig. 5, plate I. ] 3.

Windhover certainly suggests the meaning of Stand-gale, and that word would be easily shortened into Stannel. Who has not heard the sharp, ringing, half-laughiug cry ol the Kestrel? What nest-hunter has not often been warned by that well-known sound, as he came near some scarp of rocks, wood-beset, >\\\\'cll qualiflea to furnish some ledge or crevice to hold the loosely-compacted structure of sticks and wool which does duty for this dainty-looking Hawk's nest ? Yes ; and have not more than one or two of us taken tiie young, and reared them to be our pets, and taken no little pleasure in their beauty and personal pride and preening cares ? Often, too, in a tree may the nest be found, and not seldom will it prove to be not built by the Kestrels themselves, but found \\u2014 perhaps as many other things are often said to be that certainly were never \\\" lost\\\" before they were \\\" found '' \\u2014 ready-made to their wants by some luckless Crow or Magpie.

Sometimes red all over, closely spotted with deeper red ; sometimes blotched rather than spotted, and with large blotches; sometimes with a lighter ground-colour, but always tinged with red, though otherwise not so unlike the Sparrow-hawk's as not to remind one of that bii-d's eggs. I like to see, and I like to hear the Kestrel, though it is no dainty song he sings.

Mice seem to form a favourite, if not staple, article of their food ; but they are cot exclusive in their diet. An occasional small bird, hosts of coleoptera or beetle-kind, cock-chafers in their season, grubs, and even worms, are known to be readily eaten by them. As intimated above, the species is everywhere familiar, and is alike too beautifid and too useful to be so wantonly killed as it too often is.- -Fiff. G, plaie I. 14. GOSHAWK\\u2014 (Jsiur palimbarius). We do not often see the Goshawk in any part of the kingdom, and very rarely indeed, except in some parts of Scotland and in Orkney. It, like the Peregrine, was in much request for the sport of Hawking : only, as its manner of flight was different from that of the Falcon, it was used for the pursuit of different species of game from the latter. Probably this really originated in the impulses of the Goshawk's own Instinct, which leads it to attack Hares and Rabbits, or birds which, like the Partridge and Grouse, never voluntarily fly at any great height above the level of the ground. One curious habit of this bii-d is that of waiting patiently imtil some bird, which it has driven to covert, leaves its shelter, when the pursuit \\u2014 after a pause of perhaps several hours \\u2014 is immediately resumed, and probably carried to its purposed result. Most of the other Hawks, when baffled in the way noticed, very speedily relinquish all apparent thought or recollection of the escaped creature, and proceed to seek for a fresh quarry. It builds its nest on some high tree; only the tree selected is never found in the inner and deep parts of the wood and forest. Like many other birds, both predatory and other, it will often return to the same nest, adding whatever rej'airs may be required, for several successive years. It lays three or four eggs, of a pale faint blue, quite untinged with any other colour. 3^ BRITISH BIRDS, THEIR EGGS AND NESTS. 15. STA'R'ROW-'RA.WK\\u2014CAccipaer Nisus.) Sometimes called Pigeon-Hawk. \\u2014 Another short-winged hawk, as the last named also was, but vastly more common and familiarly known. Some of the Falcons already named may be fitly called bold, or fearless ; the Sparrow-Hawk may be pronounced audacious, or impudent. If you hear some careful, Martha-like housewife of a hen skirling and fussing, in dire alarm, her terrified chicks, the -while^ seeking any possible shelter, you may DC almost certain that the gliding form you caught a glance of rounding the corner of the barn and making a rapid, but by no means noisy stoop, among the young poultry of various kinds in lively attendance on their mothers, \\u2014 you may be tolerably sure that the intruder was a Sparrow-Hawk, and that some hapless Dove or Chicken has lost the number of his mess. Not that he does not like wild game as well as tame poultry. Mr. Selby mentions one nest, containing five young ones, in or close to which were found a Peewit, two Blackbirds, a Thrush, and two Green-finches, aU fresh, and half plucked. The Sparrow-Hawk is believed seldom to give itself the trouble of building a nest for itself. Some old or deserted nest of the Crow or Magpie, particularly the former, and whether in a fork of the tree or liigh among its top, usually serves its turn ; and in this, very slightly repaired if at all, the mother bird lays four or five eggs, of a pale blueish white, abundantly and most variable blotched with dark red brown. In some few eggs tliis darker colour is more sparingly bestowed ; but they are not frequent, and, usually, the red is more or less confluent about some part of the egg \\u2014 either end or the middle \\u2014 more rarely dispersed in very distinct spots, \\u2014 Fig 7, plate I. 16. KITE \\u2014 (Milvus vulgaris) . Glead, Glade, Gled, Pork-tailed Kite or Glead, Puttock, Crotchet-tailed Puttock. COMMON BUZZARD. 35 One very rarely sees a Kite nowadays in our customary ield ramblings and observings; though, to be sure, some one did \\u25a0^\\\\T.-ite word not long since to the \\\" Zoologist,\\\" that he had seen one sailing overhead as he walked the streets of London. Perhaps any but rather resolute nest-hunters might say, if they knew the reception sometimes accorded by a Kite to a wouldbe plunderer of its nest, \\\"Well, the loss is not without its compensation.\\\" Eor the Kite fights fiercely for its eggs or young ; and has been known to inflict damage of both dress and person on a boy attempting to plunder its nest. It is a noblelooking bird; but not distinguished, as the Falcons are, for any very remarkable degree of boldness or courage. A fussy old hen has been known to frighten one from his purposed foray on her cliickens, and he used of old to be chased (for sport, of course) by a species of Palcon \\\" to the manner \\\" trained. The nest, usually found high-up in a high tree in thick wood or forest, is made of sticks and lined with any softer material found handy, and contains two or three eggs of a dii-ty white colour, with a few spots or blotchings of dull red. They cater liberally enough for their young ; no less than twenty-two Moles having been found in one nest. \\u2014 Fig. ], plate II. 17. SWALLOW-TAILED \\\"KlT^\\u2014CNauclerm furcatus).

I well remember as a schoolboy in Essex, some thirty odd years ago, that the nests of the Puttock, as the Buzzard was invariably called in that district, were more frequently found by us than those of any other wood-building Hawk ; and many a hatch of young Buttocks it fell to my lot to see brought within the old school-gates. Wliether the Buzzard is equally abundant there now 1 cannot tell. It seems to me that 86 BRITISH BIRDS, THEIR EGGS AND NESTS. not oiily Hawks, but very many of the smaller bii'ds as weli, we much less numerous now than in the days of my boyhood; and I have heard other nest-lovers make tlie same remark. In rocky countries the Buzzard sometimes builds her nest on precipices, or steep banks ; but generally, in our ovm country, some fork iu a tree supplies either the site for the intended nest, or possibly the nest itself; for, like several otlier of the Hawks already noticed, the Buzzard seems to think tliere is a deal of sound sense in the saying, \\\" Foolish birds build fine nests for wise Hawks to live in them,\\\" and acts accordingly. Tho eggs are from two to four in number, of considerable size, and some of them approaching veiy nearly in general look and colour to the Kite's egg. It just as frequently seems to wait until its prey comes to it, aa trouble itself to go far in search of it. It is rather a sluggard and a coward to have so much the air of a fineiooking bird about it. \\u2014 Fit/. 2, plaie IT. 19. ROUGH-LEGGED B^ZZARB\\u2014fBufeo lagopus).

The nest was a shallow one, composed of sticks, and lined with dead leaves of the beech. The number of eggs \\u2014 an illustration of which is f )ven \\u2014 seldom, exceeds two. \\u2014 Fig. 3, lAaie II. ASH-COLOURED HAJIXIIER, 37 21. MARSH UAJmiER\\u2014fCircus mfus). Moor Buzzard, Bald Buzzard, Marsh Hawk, Harpy, Whiteaeaded Harpy, Puttock, Duck-Hawk. \\u2014 One would hardly expect to find tliat a bird, with such a string of aliases to its name, could enjoy a very wholesome reputation. However, he's no worse than his fellows of the Hawk family, and not so bad as some of them. Probably the name of Harrier, given to this and one or two of the Hawks next named, is derived from their method of beating or quartering the ground, when in search of prey, putting one in mind of tlie evolutions of the hound similarly engaged. Tlie Marsh Harrier or Moor Buzzard (or Bald Buzzard, as I used to hear it called in Essex) builds its nest of flags or rushes \\u2014 sometimes sticks or twigs \\u2014 on the ground, amid the grass at the bottom of a fui'ze or other bush ; occasionally low in the bush itself; and again, in a tuft of reeds or rushes sufficient to serve the purposes of concealment. In it it deposits three or four eggs, white, or with only a tinge of milk blue about them. It feeds itself and its young with young water-birds, if it can meet with them \\u2014 and. its name suggests the idea that young water-birds may be met with where itself is found \\u2014 or young rabbits or birds ; a few mice and small rats doubtless not coming in as altogether unworthy of notice to such hungry customers as four young \\\" Harpies.\\\" 21. HEN -HARRIER\\u2014 ra?rK5 cyaneus). t don't give a list of country or locai names here, as usual, because I wish to draw my reader's attention to the fact, that the different names applied to the same species of Hawk, are, in several cases, partly attributable to the differences in size, and especially in plumage, dependant on sex and age in the cases in question. This is quite the case with the Harriers generally, and puriicularly with the bird new under notice. There is a 38 BRITISH BIRDS, THEIR EGGS AND NE3T!\\u00bb. remarkable difference in colour between the male and female when adidt, and a likeness when the former is immature and the latter an old bird. Thus, the old male is mainly blue, the female brown ; so he is called the Blue Hawk often, or Dove Hawk, and she the Ringtail. Like those of the Marsh Harrier, the eggs of the Hen Harrier are white, and are placed in a nest of small sticks and long, coarse grasses, built upon the ground, four or five in number, and not often varying from the uniform tint of the ground-colour by the addition of a few reddishcoloured spots or speckles. Its distinctive English name \\u2014 ZTijw-Harrier, seems to be due to the fact, that, like the sick and repentant old Fox, it appears often to consider \\\" a chicken might suit me too,\\\" and acts accordingly. But, from its habits of regularly working over stubbles and other haunts of the Partridge and other like birds, there is little doubt that it varies its diet with a little game occasionally. 23. ASH-COLOURED IIXRRIER\\u2014 {Circus cineraceus). Tills bird, for which YarreU proposed the name Montagu's Harrier, is by no means of frequent occurrence in this country, and is scarcely likely to be met with by many of our young readers. The nest, like those of the other two species of Circus just named, is usually on the ground, often not far from gorse or whin-bushes; and the eggs, four or five in number, are like those of its congeners in general colour and aj)pearance. With this bird our list of Falcorudse closes. FAMILY II.~STEIGID^. When I was a boy I remember \\u2014 only those goings-back to school were a sad hindrance \\u2014 trying or helping to make a colleo tion not of Bi-ds' eggs exactly, but of Bird's \\u2022merry-thouojhta MEANS OF FLIGHT IN THE OWl.. '62 Did our young readers ever see such a collection, or think of it ? Perhaps the answer will be \\\" No ; \\u2014 and if we had, what would it have to do with a book about Bu-ds' eggs ? \\\" I will try and show that I have a purpose in mentioning Bii'ds' merrythoughts, and that it may have something to do with such a book a5 this, and its subject. We have already agreed that classification is a useful and necessary thing ; tliat nature herself leads us to it, and shows ua how to fashion and contrive it ; nay, that the very eggs of bii'ds are, speaking generally, such in their shape and mai-kings as often to suggest the formaiion of a group out of such and such different species producing them. But the merry-thoughts and the bones they are immediately connected with, the keel-like breast bone and the side and wing bones,* will be found to do the same tiling, with respect to the collection of three or four (or more) such groups of birds, as I have just called them, into what is termed a Family. Thus, if our readers could get the opportunity of looking at the merry-thoughts and breast-bone\\\" of half-a-dozen different Hawks, they would find, with a degree of variation according to the various species selected, a very obvious and striking correspondence or resembiance. The breast-bone, in every case, would show great depth of keel and strength of substance ; and the merry -thoughts would be seen to be firm and strong, and of great or considerable substance Next, if the corresponding bones of about the same umnber of birds of the Owl-kind {Sirigidos), were taken and compared with taose of the Falcon-kind just spoken about, while the mutual \\u25a0'esembiance of the Owl-kind bones was seen to be quite as great and obvious as in the case of the Hawks ; the difference between l.he said bones of the Owls and those of the Hawks would be 1 don't {rive the scientilic names of these bones, for obvious reasons. 40 lUUTlSIl BIRDS, THEIR EGGS AND NESTS altogether strange and lialf startling, from its greatness and fcddenness. The deep keel and the strong substance of the '.rcast-bone in the Hawk has given place to a shallow keel and weak walls in the Owl, while the curved, strong, broad, solid merry-thought has become a fork with thin, straight, weak, yielding shanks. So great and plain is the difference that any sharp intelligent boy could almost dii-ectly pick out for himself all the Hawk bones, and all the Owl bones, and put them in their several groups. And if he did, I think he would say to himself, and most likely to some other person, as soon as he met with one likely to be able to answer hmi, Wliat does this difference in these bones of these birds of different Families mean ? \\u2014 In plain words, it means difference in powers of flight. Any of our school-boy readers who wanted to prise his strong school-box open, because he nad lost his key, would not take his peu-knife for the purpose ; because he would think it foolish to use so weak an instrument for so strong an effort. A great strong cliissel would be much more likely to serve his purpose. And so is the work of God's hand. If a long, strong wing has to be moved rapidly, and even vehemently, the motion, like all animal motion, must be given by muscles. But the muscles must be fixed to wliat they are intended to move, or they cannot acton it; and they must be fixed at some other point also, or they would waste their power on nothing, instead of impartingmotion. And, of course, the stronger they are, the stronger must what they are fixed to be, and the larger also to admit of more and more strength. Well, the muscles that move the bird's wing are affixed at their other extremities to its breastbone and men-y-thought, and hence the size and strength of these bones in the Falcon kind with their vigorous, impetuous l%ht and sweep of wing; and the o iiUj-aruuve insigiiiricance and MEANS OF FLlbilT IN THE OWLS. 4.\\\\ wcakrioss of Uie same parts in the slow-flying, noiseless-winged Owlet. If our young friends are disposed (o udJ, in their collection of birds' eggs, ti^e so-called merry-l liought of each sepai'ate bird to the eggs laid by that bird, they will be apt to learn an interesting and instructive lesson in elementary anatomy. And such a collection may be made to a great exteu!,, without much trouble, by almost every one who has the ordinary facLHties of a residence in the country at his command. Having said so much to show how even the most simple and obvious and familiar dilTerences in the bone structure of birds suggests, or, if not, confirms the principle of classification of bii'ds, and therefore of their eggs, let us now go on to notice our quaint \\\"feathered friends,\\\" the Owls, and especially our more famihar acquaintance among them. There are other things belonging to the Owl family, which our sharp young friend just named would have just as little trouble in picking out from a heap of similar objects, as in the case of the bones. I mean the eggs. The same character, however much they vary in size \\u2014 and they do vary vastly in size \\u2014 is common to every one of the eggs. They are all white ; they are all very slightly oval, or very nearly round, and you cannot tell wh'ch is meant to be the big end, and which the little. Of course, this being the case, it would be of very little use to take up the small space available for illustration in this book, with representations of Owls' eggs ; and for the same reason, as little as possible will be said in the way of description. Any Owl's eggs which are likely to come under the notice of the school-boy nest-hunter wUl tell himagooddeal about their origin, bj their size and the place they are found in ; and the best picture ana description possible would not be able to teach him half as much. Just as the bones, noticed a page or two back, would be found to show that there was a sort of approach to something like a \\u00abS BRITISH BIRDS, THEIK EGGS AND NE5>TS. noticeable connection between the Harriers and the Owls, so the eggs of the former seem to hint at something of the same \\u00a3ind. The merry-thought and breast-bone of the Harriers are yastlj less strong and solid than those of the true Falcons ; and, so to speak, intermediate in such respects between these and those of tlie truest Owl, while the eggs are colourless or nearlj so, and so approach again to the Owl type. 24. EAGLE OWL\\u2014 {Bubo maximus.) This noble bird, the first on our list of British Owls, is sa occasionally and irregularly seen in Britain, that it can scarcely claim lengthened notice at our hands. 25. SCOPS EARED OWL.\\u2014 {Scops Aldrovattdi). Almost, or rather certainly, more rare than the preceding. 26. LONG-EARED OWL.\\u2014 {Otus vulgaris). Met with, though not very abundantly, in most parts of England. Its haunt during the day time is in ivy bushes, or other retreats affording security from the access of much light, its nest is most frequently an appropriated old nest of the Crow or Magpie ; perhaps even what was once the breeding-home of the Squirrel; and m it are laid four or five eggs IW inch long, by ] 2 ? iiich broad. It seeks its prey after sunset ; and as birds of various kinds are known to form part of its food, it seems almost certain that they must be taken as they sit at roost. What sad bug-a-boos Horned Owls must be made to offending j uveniles in little-bird nurseries. 27. SHORT-EARED OWL\\u2014 (Oto brachyotus). Woodcock Owl, Short-horned Howlet, Mousehawk, Hawk Owl. It breeds with us, but not very commonly, and many seem to come over in the autumn, and they are then frequently Been is a stubble, or otherwise roused by the sportsman. It*. BASN OWL, 43 nest is sometimes on the ground, and perhaps even in a rabbitburrow. The eggs are thi-ee in number, and scarcely differ the least in size from those of the bii-d last named. Young Grouse and other birds breeding about the moors are abundantly supplied by the parent Owls to their young when the nest chances to have been made in such a locality, and the old ones are very jealous of seeing their progeny too nearly approached, and expose themselves almost as fearlesaly on such occasions as either Partridge or Grouse. Tiieir local name of Ilawk-Owl is derived from the circumstance that they pursue their prey \\u2014 regularly \\\"hawking\\\" for it \\u2014 daring the daytime. 2S. EARN 0\\\\N'L\\u2014{Slj-lxJlammed). White Owl, Yellow Owl, Screech Owl, Gilly Howlet, Howlet, Madge Howlet, Church Owl, Hissing Owl. \\u2014 This common and useful bird breeds by preference in some building or part of one . a church tower, dove-cot, ruined mansion, or castle, and the Hke. My most familiar boy-acquaintance, however, was with the nesting place and habits of a pair which nested for many consecutive years in a slight hollow in the crown of a large pollard Elm tree in my father's church-yard in Essex. Thero were usually three or four young ones year by year, often with perceptible differences of growth among tliem. Indeed it is well kno\\\\Tn that this Owl and the last named, and probably others as well, lay their eggs in instalments, as it were, and when the first batch of two is about hatching or nearly so, other two are deposited in addition, and thus hatched in their turn almost as much by their brother and sister as by thfiir mother. Quainter, graver, odder, stranger, more irresistibly comic creatm-es than these young Owls I never saw; and the hissing and snormg, and peering looks at the spectator, and strange \\\"ntic contortions I heard and saw, bafHe all attempts 44 BRITISH BIKDS, THEIR \\u00a3GCiS AND iitSTS, at description. The eutcrtainment, for such it was most truly, usually begaa some little time before sunset, about which time the old bii'ds might be seen commencing thoir hibours of purveying food for Masters and Misses Howlet. At intervals of from seven to ten minutes one or other of them came to the nest with a prey, and I could always tell by the sounds and gestures of the young Owls when the old one was approaching. How they knew I could not tell ; it was not by sight, and I could hear no sound myself; but know they did most certainly. Mice, slugs, sometimes a large insect apparently, or a small bird, very rarely a Mole, or Eat of no large dimensions, were brought in continuous succession, and in the claw, not with the bUl. When the animal was of small dimensions, the old Owl flitted off again ivith scarcely any pause at the nest. It a large one, it seemed by the time which elapsed, and the sounds which became audible \\u2014 most vehement suorings and hissings \\u2014 that partition had to be made, and that the said partition was a matter ol the greatest interest to the parties concerned. I cannot affirm positively that the old Owls prosecuted then- most successful hunting all through the night ; but T believe they did, and I have seen them still at work in the morning long after sun-rise, once as lale as between eight and nine in the morning in the height of summer. As the inmates of a dove-cot, they are on very excellent terms with the proper dwellers therein, although from the known habits of other Owls the human ownens oi the dove-cot are apt to assume, most groundlessly and unjustly, th\\u00bb,t they are sure to destroy the yoimg Pigeons. I don't believe, however, that if all the rejected pellets of bones, fur, feathers, fee, from all the Barn Owls in the kingdom could be examined, tliat any trace of pigeon, old or young, would be discovered ; and that fanner is a foolish farmer who either destroys m Bam TAWNY QWL. 4s Owl himself or suffers any one else, whom he coT;ld prevent, to destroy one. They are perfectly harmless, exceedingly useful, and strangely interesting to the observer. I may add that since I began to write these lines, I am told that the self-same tree is still occupied by a pair of the self-same Owls, and has continued to be from the days of my boyish recollections \\u2014 a period of more than thirty yeais. The young of this and the next species are very bold, resolute little creatures, if taken when rather more than half-grown. They wiU throw themselves on their backs, and defend themselves pertinaciously with bill and claw against any foe, or supposed foe, human or other. The Barn Owl lias been known to take fish by plunging upon it in the water. The eggs are about li inch long, by 1| broad. 29. TAWNY 0'V^'L\\u2014{Si/rnium stridula). Brown Owl, Wood Owl, Hoot Owl, Ivy Owl, Jenny Howlet. This is the bird whose well-known and, as I think, musical note is so often heard at night in wooded countries, in the genuine \\\"tu-whit-to-who-o-o-o,\\\" or \\\"hoot.\\\" The last-named, or Barn Owl, is the Screech Owl proper, though not, in my experience, very much addicted to indulge in her unpleasant song. I very seldom used to hear a downright good screech in those old days. The Brown Owl makes its nest \\u2014 at least, lays its eggs \\u2014 in some lioUow tree, usually in a wood or near one. Some times a few feathers or a little moss may receive the eg^?,, often only the decayed wood. I have heard of the nest of this bird in other positions ; e.ff., in a deserted Crow's nest, or a hole in a rocky bank. But the hollow tree is the rule. The eggs are three or four in number, and larger than the Barn Owl's, being about lj\\u00a7 inch long, by 1| inch broad. The old birds nave two or three notes besides the hoot; one being a short, rather Bnarp cluck, often repeated. The young ones, after they fly 46 BRITISH BIRDS, THEIR EGGS AND NESTS. depend a good deal on their parents' exertions for food, which consists of young Rabbits, Hares, now and then birds of sorts. Rats, Mice, &c. I once saw a young Brown Owl, apparently waiting for its food to be brought, and sitting very still on the topmost bough of a tall tree, aimost knocked off his perch by the whizzing flight of a Wild Duck. The Owl ducked liis head, or I thought the Duck would have actually struck him, so near was the encounter. 30. SNOWY OWL\\u2014iSurnianyctea). A beautiful bird, of very rare occurrence. 31. HAWK OWL\\u2014{Surmaftinerea). Canada Owl \\u2014 ]\\\\Iore rare than the last. 32. LITTLE OVJlj\\u2014{Noctt(a passerind). Little Night Owl, Sparrow Owl \\u2014 A very occasional visitant. 33.

GEJEAT GKEY SHRIKE\\u2014 (Z\\u00ab\\u00ab?\\u00abs excubitor). Greater Butchel Bird, Ash-coloured Shrike, Cinereous Shrike. Grey Shrike \\u2014 This bird is an occasional visitor only, and has very rareiy been seen in the breeding season. No authentic instance of its nesting with us is known. 35. RED-BACKED SHRIKE\\u2014 (Z\\u00ab\\u00abj\\u00ab\\u00ab eoUurtd). Lesser Butcher Bird, Elusher, Murdering-pie, Jack Baker, SPOTTED FLY-CATCHER. 47 &c. \\u2014 nie male of this species is a beautiful bird, with his bright cnesnut back and lively air. They spend only a part of the year with us, but that part involves the period of nesting. The nest is usually rather high up in a strong, thick bush, large-sized for the bird, cup-shaped, and made of coarse withered herbage externally, with rather finer materials within, and lined with hair or some such substance. The eggs are four or five in number, varying much in colour and marks. The ground-shade varies, and so do the markings ; the latter, however, being usually found thicker and darker in a zone or band encircling some part of the egg. Description is quite inadequate to convey any idea of these variations. The bird deserves its name, for it \\\" slaughters \\\" small birds, as well as other animals, and hangs up the carcases in regular shambles. It is wonderful how the frogs, beetles, caterpillars, cock-chafers, bii'ds, &c., which form its food, are fixed so very firmly and tenaciously upon the strong thorny point. \\u2014 Fiffs. 4, 5, plate II. 36. WOODCHAT SHRIKE\\u2014 (Z:\\u00ab\\u00abt\\u00abs ru/us). Only an occasional visitant. II.\\u2014 MUSCICAPID^. 37. SPOTTED 'E'LYGA.TCTn^R\\u2014iMusctcapa^risola). Beam-bird, Bee-bird, Rafter -bu'd. Post-bird, Wall-bird, Cherry. chopper. Cherry-sucker, Cobweb-bu'd. Many of these names are taken from the familiar site of its nest, or from some of its habitti in taking food. It will return to the same post, after a short eicursion to seize an insect, ten or a dozen times m succession ; und it wUl build its nest on a wall, on the end of a rafter or beam, on a rake-head, in a trained wall-tree \\u2014 in fact, in almost every conceivAble place. The nest varies in material and struo 48 BRITISH BIRDS, THErR EGGS AND NESTS ture, almost as much as in its site. Moss, old and new, bents, straws, twigs, hairs, feathers, all are used. It is an amusing little bird, and pays many feeding visits to its young, as is the case with all insect-feeding birds. The eggs are four or Cwe in number, of dull white, tinged with blue, and spotted with faint red. It only visits us to breed here. \\u2014 Fi^. G, picde IT. 38. m:D JLYCATCBER\\u2014iiVuscicapa atricapilla.) Goldfinch. \\u2014 A rare bird in some localities, and not an abundant one in any. The nest is loosely made of small roots, bents, grass, moss, hair, or some such material, iu a hole, usually in pollard trees, or such as have decayed from natural causes, but sometimes also in a hole in a wall or other building. In it may \\\\if^ found four to eight eggs of a uniform light blue coloui-. \\u2014 Fig. 7, jjiate IT. III.\\u2014 MEEULIDJE. 39. COMMON DIPPER\\u2014 (a\\u00abefe\\u00ab aquaticus.) Water-ouzel, Brook-ouzel, Water-crow, Water-piet, Bessyducker. \\u2014 I may as well own that I am a little bit \\\" fond \\\" about the Dipper. I dearly love to see him and hear liim in my rambles by our mountain becks. So lively, cheery, and jolly, even In the cold winter day, when the mere look of the chilly, shivering stream makes one feel goosc-skirmy. There he sits at the water edge, and sings like a Robin a little tipsy, and then in he tumbles, in a rollicking sort of way, as you become a little too niquisitive, and emerging a few yards further down, takes wing, and darts off v ith his Kingfisher-like flight. One nest some lads belonging to my family found here, was a feather-bed sort of structure of moss and a few feathers, filling up a six-inch square hole in the masom^y of a bridge in wliich one of the scaffold- MISSEL THRUSH. 49 rafters of the workmen had been inserted, there being a small, rouna nole left in the exposed side for exit and ingress. Others may be seen in cavities in a rock by the water-side ; and one 1 heard of, if my memory is correet, in Berwickshire, was built amid the stone-work of a water-lead for conducting the waste water away from a mill, and in sucii a position that the water in :ts fall projected itself beyond the nest, and formed a kind of arch above it. The old birds in going into or leaving their nest had actually to pass in either from the side or through the interstices of the small cascade. The eggs are five or six in number, and perfectly, purely white. A sad enemy to fish spawn 1 fear my little while-breasted friend is. I never yet carea to shoot one, I love them so well. But when there are half-a-dozen small but very hungry Dipper-mouths to be fed, I fear much consumption of fishes' food, as well as fishes' eggs, takes place. It is able to walk, though with much effort, under water, as weU as dive and swim ; and I have often seen them, on coming to the surface in a quiet pool, remain perfectly quiescent and floating for several seconds, \\u2014 Fig. S, j^late II. 40. MISSEL THUUSH\\u2014 (r\\u00ab/-t/\\u00abs viscivorus). Misseltoe Thrush, Missel-bird, Stormcock, Screech Thrush, Holm Thrush, Holm Screech. \\u2014 A handsome bu-d and an early builder. The Missel Thrash seems to lay aside some of its wildness in the breeding season, and draws near the dwellings of men. Its nest may continually be found in a garden or orchard close to a house, and in the thick fork of an apple or other fruit tree, often only a few feet from the ground. Woe be to the Cat who comes near the nest ! Such a storm of violent abuse and loud-tongued birds' Billingsgate as is poured on her devoted head ! Nor does the human intruder escape quite without a telling of it, or what my 60 BRITISH BIRDS, THEIR EGGS AND N\\u00a3ST\\u00bb. Yorksliire friends term \\\" a calling.\\\" If a Missel Thrush is very angry with you, be sure his nest is not far off. It is a larsjo structure, of much such materials and design as the Blackbird's, but often bound round and round with long rushes or roots, or other material sufficiently lengthy and pliable. The eggs, tour or five in general, often vary much in colouring and marks ; but are in general of a whitish ground-colour, lightly tinged with green (or perhaps faint red), and well spotted with red-brown. \\u2014 Fig. 9, Tplate II. 41.

Felfit, Felty-fare, Blue-back, Jack-bird. \\u2014 A very common winter visitor, and staying sometimes as late as 10th May. But they do not breed with us ; and as space is not too abundant, any notice which can be afforded of this bu-d's nesting habits must be put in the Appendix, if found possible. 43. COMMON THRUSH\\u2014 (r\\u00abriKS musicus). Song Thrush, Throstle, Mavis. \\u2014 Every one knows this sweet songster, and could point out its pet stone v/ith its little accumulation of shattered snail shells, which, when whole, had been brought there by the knowmg Thrush and hammered agamst the well-fixed anvil until they gave way. Every body knows his persevering song, begun at day-dawn in early February, and persevered in for months of the spring and early summer. Every one knows its trim, neatly-plastered nest, with its warm, solid coating of grass and bents and roots and such like materials. And every body too, knows the four or five fair blue eggs with iheir tidy black spots, which now and then, however, can hardly be seen at all. Every body also knows how fussy the old mother BLACRBILD. 51 Thrush is the day her brood quit their nest ; and how, if you catch one of her luvkward, ill-ilying, soon-tired squad of young ones, she will follow you with much objurgation and no little plaintive entreaty that \\\"a great fellow like you, who ought to be ashamed of yourself for frightening a poor little fluttering creatur-e like that, will put it down again soon, and not hurt it, and be a dear, good man, \\u2014 now do, won't you ! \\\" \\u2014 Fig. 10, plate II. * 42.

Merle in Shakspeare. \\u2014 The Blackbird's tawny bill and sable plumage aud sweet meUow song \\u2014 would one like it as well if he were as lavish of it as the Thrush ? \\\"Who does not welcome and love him ? A:id to a very youthful nest-hunter what a deserving bird the Blackbird is. Making his nest usually in such places and so that detection is not at all a matter of course, and yet not altogether beyond the discenmient of inexperienced eyes. The discovery of our first Blackbkd's nest is always felt to be a sort of achievement, aud one to be spoken of with ixasonable seK- approbation too. Li the hedge, at the bottom of the hedge, on the stump, behind the stump, below the stump, an exciesence on the side of the ragged old tree, in a wall tree, in an evergreen or other thick bush \\u2014 how often have we found the nest ic these and such like places. Once we found one which we sel donm as made by the untidiest Blackbird that ever lived. It was Li a thorn hedge thick and high, and a great rough structure. But a lock of wool, a big one, had been unmanageable and had E 2 53 BKlTISll BIRDS, TUEIR EGGS AND NEStfl. caught on the thonis, and the feathered architect couIJ do nothing with it, and there it hung out of the ncst-wali a thick tangle, inches long, and making the nest as conspicuous as it a flag had been stuck just above it.

A bold abusive freebooter in our gardens in North Yorkshire, and other similar localities. lie's a beautiful bird, and a wary, except when seduced by strawberries and red currants. His wild and not unmusical note, though it might sound harsh in a trim garden in Kent or Essex, and to an ear not attuned to moorland sounds, is always as welcome to me as the gentler twitter of the Swallow. I like to hear his attempts at song, reminding the listener of the Missel-bird's early spring music. kxA I like to hear his wilder, grating call-note, which is the usual warning the ornithologist has that the Moor Blackbird has returned for the season. His nest is very like the Blackbird's in design and general structure. An inner lining of bents and fine ling, a wall of clay, and an outer husk of moss, ling, and such like moorland matters. It is not strongly or compactly formed, and makes a great litter if kept a day or two and subject to be handled or moved, however carefully. It is always built on, or near the ground, on the wild moor ; and I once trod the feathers out of the wing of a sitting hen, oa whom and her nest 1 nearly trod in leaping a guUy. The eggs are usually four or five in number, and remind you of the Blackbird's eggs in I heir general appearance; but the blotchings or markings are redder, and often much larger or more pronounced than in the K(;IUN. 53 case of llie Blackbird. Their eggs, too, vary generally in size, even in the same nest. Out of the contents of two nests I had brought to me a year or two since, no two seemed to agree exactly in dimensions. \\u2014 Fig. 12, flute II, 45.

It was Hedge-Sparrow in my childhood and youth, and Hedgesparrow to me it will be called to the end of the chapter.

The mossy nest, with its intermixture of fino roots and hairs, may be found weeks before leaves are thought of, on the bank-side or low in the hedge, and little concealed ; and the four or five \\\"beautiful blue eggs in it become familiar to every nest-seeker among his very earliest acquisitions. \\u2014 Fig. 13,plaie!T, 48.

It seems to be, or to liave been, a common reeling among boys, and is embodied in the old lines : \\u2014 \\\" The Robin and the Wren Are God's Cock and Hen.\\\" ITow beautiful the Robin's eggs are when just laid ; and how they lose their peculiar pinky loveliness from being blown. A hundred different places, too, the little bird selects for the site of its nest ; often being such, moreover, as to illustrate their confiding fearlessness, as much as the result in them of the pressure of winter cold and hunger. In the tilt ot a wagon ; in a steam-boat ; in a room of the cottage ; near a blacksmith's forge ; in the constantlyused garden-shed, as well as in the ivy or evergreen bush ; or on the bank, or in the hedge ; or in a hole in the old ruin or bank or house-wall : all places seem to suit it alike. The eggs are five or six, sometimes seven; and the shell is wliite, more or less freckled with light red. \\u2014 Fig, 14, plate II. 49. BLUE-THROATED WARBLER\\u2014 (P//^\\u00ab/cKm Suecica).

Eiretail, Fireflirt, BrantaU, Redtail. \\u2014 The male is one of the most beautiful of cm- small birds, and I wish I could think it as abundant with us as it used to be. The nest is loosely constructed of moss, with a few small straws or bents sometimes, and hair and feathers inside, and almost invariably is placed iu a hole, it may be in a hollowish tree, or a wall, or even in a bank ; and here, where dry-stone walls abound, its choice of nestingplaces is inexhaustible. Very watchful are the old birds over the eggs, and very fussy and noisy when the eggs have yielded their living contents, and yet very careful too. I knew there was a nest the vear before last not far from my garden gate ; but it was WUIN-CUAT. 55 not till I hid myself most carefully and patiently beliind the door, that I made myself master of the vigilant little sentinel's secret. It lays four or five, and, occasionally, six eggs, of a pale uniform blue colour, perhaps tinged with a faint green shade. They ire almost as pretty as the Hedge-Sparrow's. \\u2014 Fig. 15, plate II. 51. BLACK REDSTART\\u2014 (P/5^\\u00ab?VKra Tithys). Tithys, Redstart, Black Red-tail. \\u2014 It has been met with in Britain perhaps half-a-dozen times, or rather more, 51. STONE-CHAT\\u2014 (5'a.T/co/a ruLicolu). Sione-cliatter, Stone-clink, Stone-smick, Stone-chack, Stonesmith, Moor-titling, Chick stone, Black-cap. \\u2014 A very rommon bb:d m many districts, and from his habits much more familiarly and commonly known and noticed than other birds equally or even more abundant, but of less obtrusive, or quieter habits. Flitting about from bush to bush, and seating himselfpertly on the top spray, there he sits and \\\" cliats \\\" or \\\" clinks \\\" till the passenger comes too near, and then off he flies again, to perch again a few yards fiu'ther and repeat the same performance. The nest, sometimes very neat and well-constructed, of moss and benty grass, and lined with hair, feathers, fine grass-stalks, &c., is often quite on the groimd and with no bush near ; sometimes at the foot of a low bush, or in the bush itself, but very near the ground. The eggs are five or six, of a pale blue ground, very sparingly freckled with dull reddish brown, and chiefly near the large end. The nest is often hard to find, and especiaDy when built among longish herbage, or in or near a whin-bush. \\u2014 Fig. 16, plate II. 53. WHIN-CHAT.\\u2014 (^^orjVo^a ruhctra). Grass-cnat, Eurze-chat. \\u2014 Many of the bnds last-named pass the whiter in England ; but only a few of the Whin-chats. This is never so abundant a species as the last, and though with some 50 BRITISH BIRDS, TIIKIR EGGS AND N' tSTs, Bimilar habits it has no urgent inclination to force us to notice it by the incessant repetition of its note. The nest strongly resembles that of the Stone-chat. It is also usually placed on the ground, and is folly as hard to find as that bird's. The eggs, five or six of them, are of a uniform blueish green, very slightly speckled or marked with dull-red. \\u2014 Fig, 17, plate II. 54. WHEAT-EAR\\u2014 (5'\\u00ab.nco/a cenanthe). Eallow-chat, \\\"VVhite-rump, \\\"V\\\\Tiite-tail, Eallow-smick, Fallowfinch, Chacker, Chackbird, Clodhopper, with some other quainter names still, which I have noted down, and yet another or two common to the Wlieat-ear and Stone-chat, such as Stone-ohacker. A common bird enough liere, and with some of the more obvious habits of the Stone-chat. It perches on the stone walls as one approaches it, and flirts its tail and chacks, and then diving below the wall on the far side, re-appears again ten or twelve yards lower, and acts as before ; and so on for a hundred yards or more. The stone walls in our district and the large heaps of stones, removed in reclaiming parts of the moor and flung promiscuously together any where to be out of tlie way, afford them capital breeding places. In other countries old walls, or holes in the sides of pits or excavations, serve their purpose. The nest is not very artistic or well-finished, and formed of many different materials \\u2014 bents, feathers, dry roots, fur, in short any waste matters which may have come in the way of the builders. The Eggs are five or six in number, and of a pale-blue colour not so dark as tliose of the Hedge-Sparrow. It is said that ])eople accustomed to the habits of the Wheat-eai- are al)lc to find its nest without dilBcidty, from the occurrence r.f certain noticeable sicrr-s ii: its neighbourhood. \\u2014 Vlrj. ], jilale III. REED WAKULKK. 57 55. GllASSHOPPER WARBLER\\u2014 (Salicana locusteUa). A summer visitor, of shy and retired habits, and very vigilant. Its note, very shrill and constantly repeated, reminding one of tlie Crieket or Grassliopper's note, gains it its name. The nest is liard to find, and unless the bird be very closely watched, it may baffle a good observer. It is placed in spots matted and overhung with growtli of grass or other herbage and bushes ; is cup-shaped, made of coarse dry grass, wiLli finer within ; and contains sometimes as many as seven eggs, of a pale pinky-white colour, freckled witli spots of a darker shade of red.\\u2014 ^;V7. 2, plate III. 56. SEDGE WAllBLEIl-(&/j6-\\u00aby7\\u00ab phragmilis). Tin's everlasting little songster is more conniion tiian the bird last named, and almost every boy knows its peculiar chiding note. Many a lad, too, knows that by shying a stone in near its haunt, its notes may be elicited almost any hour in the night or day. I think I have neard it singing on all through the night, and notwithstanding the absence of any pretence at dayUght. Its nest is usually placed near the ground, in the vicinity of more or less water, and is supported, as well as concealed, by the coarse lierbage. Made of coarse grass stalks externally, and lined witli finer ones and hair, sometimes with a foundation of moss, five or SIX eggs are deposited in its cup-shaped lioUow, of a pale brown colour, a little mottled witli darker brown. \\u2014 Fig. 3, plate III. 57.

Almost as zealous a songster as the Sedge Warbler. There are few hours in the twenty-four 55 BKITISII BIRDS, THEIR EGGS AND NESTS. when its voice may not be heard about its accustomed haunts ; namely, willow and reed beds, and particularly the latter. The nest is, perhaps, the deepest made by any English bu-d,'and quite a long inverted none in shape. It is affixed lo, or rathei built so as to include turee or four reeds, or more. So that, however the wind blows, it is quite fast, wliile its great depth prevents the eggs falling out, even if the reeds be blown almost level. The bird has been seen still sitting when the violent gusts forced the nest down almost to the water level. The nest is made of long grass and the seed-stalks of the reed, and lined with wool or the like. Four or five eggs of a greenish-wliite Dolour, marked in spots and dashes of green and pale brown, are usually laid. \\u2014 yirj. 4, plate III. 59. NIGHTINGALE.\\u2014 (P/ii7oOTe/a iKscitiia). This sweetest of the English warblers has but a limited range [n Essex, Suffolk and Cambridgeshire, I used to hear it abundantly ; but of late years, as a resident in Yorkshire, its note iias become strange in my cars. Shy and vigilant in its habits, it does not willingly expose itself to observation, and its haunts are so thick that discovery of its nest is not always easy. It seems often an untidy structui'c, but according to my observation, not usually built on the ground, as Mr. Yarrcll states. I have found it in a thick thorn hedge or bush, and in slu'ubs in the tjarden; made of twigs, straw, grass, and especially old oak leaves, and with only a jagged margm. The eggs, four aud sometimes five of them, are of \\\" an uniform olive-brown colour,\\\" and from the time they are laid, the bird only sings occasionalij. Alter they are hatched, never. \\u2014 Fi^. 5, plaie III. GO. BLACKCAP. \\u2014 {Curruca atricapilla). Blackcap ^Vai-bler. \\u2014 This bird, with several others, has a local GARDKN WAKBLER. 59 or country hame in common, derivable, I believe, from the structure of the nest. I mean Hay-jack or Ilay-chat; but it is I think, much less frequently distinguished by that name than the three birds next to be mentioned. The country-boy's name for one of these must always be distrusted, as is the case also with Ids designation of other common, but much more dissimilar birds. Thus, not to mention other instances, the Blackcap proper, the Greater Tom-tit and the Stone-chat are all called Blackcap. \\u2014 The Blackcap Warbler comes to us in spring and builds in our gardens and shrubberies as frequently as ia wilder resorts, but always in places where there is thick foliage and plentiful means of concealment. It is a very shy bird and very unwilling to be gazed at. If it sees you watching it, you soon lose sight of it as it hops and twists from spray to spray into the inner and shadiest recesses of its haunt. Its nest, too, is studiously concealed, and Mr. Yarrell says it will leave two or three just-commenced nests in succession, on light grounds of suspicion that it has been noticed in its labours. The nest is a benty, and saving for the ties of wool or cobweb, a slightly compacted edifice, lined with hair and fine fibres, and contains four or five eggs of varying colour and mottlings \\u2014 white, greenish or tinged with a peculiar shade of faint red, being the groundcoloui-, with markings of a reddish brown. \\u2014 Fig. 0, plale III. Gl. GA.IIDEN WARBLER\\u2014 ((7\\u00ab;T\\u00abm hortemis). Pettychaps, Greater Pettychaps. \\u2014 Inferior to the Blackcap in song, as the Blackcap is inferior to the Nightingale, only not at so great a distance. Still it is a sweet songster. It comes to us to breed, and frequents thick hedges and the covert afforded by our shrubberies and pleasure-plantings in gardens. The nest, like the Blax;k''ap*s in materials and detail, of dry grass-stalks or 61) BRITISH BIRDS, THEIR KliGS A.SU m'sIS bents loosely twined but bound together with wool, &c., and Jined with hair and fibrous roots, may bo found among rank growth of various herbage, or in a bush, or iu a row of rodded peas. The usual four or five eggs are of muddled-white, stained and Epotted with greenish brown, lighter or darker. \\u2014 Fig. \\\", plate III. 62. WHITE-THROAT\\u2014 (C\\u00abrrac\\u00ab cinerca). Nettle-crcepcr. \\u2014 Another pleasant singer, but with occasional harsher notes, and a chiding one, not unlike the Sedgebird's, when uneasy or irritated. This is the usual Haychat of the country lads, and fully as often called the Nettle-creeper; the former name being due to the fabric of its nest, the latter to its habits of twining in and out of the leaves and coarse herbage which abound among its haunts. Little description of the nest is needed, except that it seems slighter, and is thinner at the sides than those last named, but still it is not less compact. The eggs vary a good deal in appearance, but there is still such a family likeness among them that they are easily recognizable by most eggfanciers. Green, in different shades, is the predominating colour. \\u2014Fij. 8, plate III. C3. LESSER MllYYE-1BR0kT\\u2014{Cunuca syhiella). Not so common a bird nearly, as the last, and rising higher in the bushes and shrubberies it frequents than it. It shigs low and pleasantly when you arc near enough to hear it, and very incessantly, but its more frequently heard notes are ratlier harsh. The nest, found among low bushes and brambles, is like the Whitethroat's, and the fcur or five eggs laid in it are white, speckled, most at the large end, with ash or light brown. \\u2014 Fig. 9, plate III. 64. WOOD WARBLER\\u2014 (^y/i7\\u00ab\\u00ab sibilatrix). Wood Wren, Yellow TVren. \\u2014 This bird was long confounded with the Willow AVrcn to be named next. It comes to us for CniFFCHAFF. 61 the summer, the males (as is the case with so many of tha Warblers), coming first by several days. It is abundant enough in some well-wooded parts of the kingdom, and its song is only called such by courtesy. It builds a domed nest ; that is one covered in above, and with a side entrance ; on the ground amid grass or weeds. It is made of grass, dead leaves, moss, and lined with hair and soft grass. The eggs are six in number, wiiite, and very much speckled and spotted with dark redpurple. \\u2014 Fig. 10, plate III. G5. WILLOW WREN\\u2014 (^^/f/\\u00ab trocldlus). WUiow Warbler, Yellow Wren, Scotch Wren, Hay-bird, Iluckrauck, Ground Wren. \\u2014 A well known little bird to the observant. It sings \\\" a soft and pleasuig \\\" song, and is a lively little fellow, in incessant motion. Very restless and uneasy too, when you are near its nest, and particularly if the young are hatched. The nest is domed, externally like the one last named, but always lined with feathers, wliich the last never is. It is built on a bank or bankside, among grass or other herbage, and contains five to seven eggs, white, with many small speckles of red not very dark. There is an instance on record, in which this bird did not leave its nest tliough it had been bodily removed from its site on the ground, and even before any eggs were laid or the nest itself completed \\u2014 one of the most remarkable cases of the kmd known. \\u2014 Fig. 11, plate III. 66. CHirrCHAPE\\u2014 (5y/wa hippolais). Lesser Pettychaps, Least Willow Wren. \\u2014 An \\\"early bird\\\" this is in coming to us in spring time, and able and willing enough to take its substitute for the \\\" worm.\\\" The two syllables of its name, differently accented, form its song. Its nest is like that of the ^Villow Wren, with the addition of a few dead leaves outside 62 BRITISH BIRDS, TIIEIK EGGS AND NESTS. and abundance of featliers inside, and is also placed on (or very near) the ground on a hedgebank. Tlie CbiiTcliaff lays six eggs, white, with specks of dark purplish-red. \\u2014 Fig. 12, plate III. 67. DARTFORD ^K^^ljY^^\\u2014iMelizophilusprovindaUs). A bird wliich is scarcely known except on some of the furze, growing commons of the South, especially Kent and Surrey The nest is of dry grass-stalks, loosely put together and tied with wool, and sparingly lined with other fine and dry vegetable substances. \\\" The eggs,\\\" we read in Yarrell, \\\" are somewhat similar to those of the Wliitetliroat, but rather less ; and Hke tliem, are tinged with green. They are speckled all over with olive-brown and cinereous on a greenish white groiond; the markings becoming more dense and forming a zone at the large end.\\\"\\u2014 J?y. 13, plate TIL 68. GOLD-CRESTED REGULUS\\u2014 (i?^^\\u00ab&5 crhtatm). Gold-crest, Gold-crested Wren, Golden-crested Warbler, Goldcrowned Kinglet. \\u2014 One of the smallest of our native birds and possessing a \\\" soft and pleasing song.\\\" Its nest \\u2014 one of the very most beautiful of all our English nests \\u2014 is built below the branch of a spruce fir-tree and near the end of the bough, being suspended to two or more of the spreading side-boughs. These are often woven in with the moss and wool of the nest, and then tliere is a Uuing of feathers; spiders' webs too are used to compact the structure. Seven or eight eggs are laid, which vary remarkably, in d. ffcrent nests, in both ground-shade and markings. Some remind one of the usual Robin's egg in both, though the spots are much finer. Others are pale white, with yellowishbrown (rather than red) speckles, \\u2014 Fig. 14, plate III. BLUE TITMOUSR. 63 69. FIRE-CRESTED 'KEGULUS\\u2014CRec/ulus iffmcapiUus). Much less common than the last, though very likely often confounded with it from its great general resemblance. Its nest is like its gold-crowned relation's, and the eggs seem to resemble the variety first described in the above notice of that bird. V. PARID^. 70. GREAT TITMOUSE.\\u2014 rPara* major). Great Tit, Oxeye, Blackcap, Great Blackheaded Tomtit, Pickcheese. \\u2014 It might also be called, and I believe is in one district, ths Saw-sharpener, for its note certainly puts one in mind of tha\\u00bb; agreeable musical operation. The Tomtits are familiar to all of us, and \\\"impudent\\\" is one of the epithets we most usually apply to the whole tribe. Most of them breed in some hollow place or hole. The nest of the Great Tit is formed of moss, with a feather lining, and is sometimes placed in a hole in a wall ; sometimes in some appropriate recess in a hollow tree. Like the other Tits, it lays many eggs, occasionally from six to nine. They are white, of fair size, and well spotted as well as speckled with a decided shade of red. There is an easHy recognised resemblance between the eggs of all the Tomtit family. \\u2014 Fig. 15, plate III. 71. BLUE TITMOUSE\\u2014 (^Par?;5 caruleus). Tomtit, Blue Tomtit, Nun, Blue-cap, Blue-bonnet, BiUy-biter, Hickwall, Blue Mope. \\u2014 One of the most impudent of an impudent lot. A pair had biult their nest in a crevice between the lintel and stonework of my coacli-house, and my children from their nursery window observed it. Eor their amusement I got a ladder and looked in. The bold little matron could not be induced to leave the hole, but spit and hissed like a regulai 64 BRITISH niivus, their eggs and nests. vixen, and tried to make herself as big -as two by ruflling up het featlicrs, so as to friglitcn the owners of tlic ugly faces, as she would tliiuk, she saw at her door. Often, too, have I been bitten sharply by one I had laid hold of. Almost any hole in any object will do for the nest-site. Even a bottle, a wooden box, a pump-barrel, a quccr-sliaped cavity in an old tree only big enough to admit such a small creature, all are made available. The nest is voluminous, of moss, hair, and feathers ; and the eggs are abnosl endless. From six up to twelve or thirteen is of common occur rence. Llr. Ilewitson mentions one case of eighteen eggs 1 They are white, and spotted with pale red. The jouiTicys of the old birds to and from the nest when supplying their large family with food are literally innumerable ; and the number of small catcr])Lllars, grubs, plant-lice, and the like, destroyed by these jidefatigable caterers, must be simply astonishing. I think the pair just now referred to made at least one visit to the nest every two minutes throughout the day. The climbing, clinging habits of this and other Tomtits are very amusing; and in former days I made them dance on the slack-rope for my amusement and my friends'. 1 strung a nut or two on a piece of strong thread, and tied the two extremities to a tree and a nail in a wall near the window, respectively. This plan gave me many lengthened opportunities for watching their ways. I have also seen them stripping off the loose bark from pine-planks and picking out the fine fat grubs which eat their way between the wood and the bark. \\u2014 Eig. IG, flate III. 72.

Incessantly active and frequently associating with other small bii'ds it prosecutes a restless search for the small insects and seeds which form its food. Ita nest, of moss and wool and hair, is placed in a hole in a tree, sometimes very near the ground ; sometimes even in a hole in the ground which has been made by some small quadi-uped. Like the other Tits, if necessary it wiU enlarge a hole in. a tree which it finds already such as nearly to suit its requirements. Sis to eight eggs are laid, white, and spotted with faint red. 74. l^IARSII TITMOUSE.\\u2014 (Ptfr/^? pduslris). Coal-head, Black-cap, \\\"Willow-biter. \\u2014 A plentiful species in places ; but as its name intimates, with a preference for districts with the peculiar low growth of bush and willow found in low fenny countries. It makes its nest in old willows and the low stunted trunks of pollard trees, and will labour hard to make a nearly suitable hole quite serviceable. It is said to carry the chips it makes quite away to some distance. The nest is better built than those of the Tits hitherto named, of moss and wool ; and the number of eggs varies from live or six to eight or even ten. They are of the usual Tom-tit type, white, spotted with red. 75. LONG-TAILED TITMOUSE.\\u2014 (Paras candatus.) Lcng-tailed Mag, Mum-ruffin, Bottle-tit, Bottle-tom, Longtailed Capon, Long-tail Pie, Caper Long-tail, Oven-buUder, Poke-pudding, Mulllin, &c., &c. \\u2014 The beautiful, even wonderful nest of this little bird must be well-known to almost all nestfanciers\\u2014 oval, of great size compared with the tuiy architect; built, too, entirely by the female, wondrously compacted with moss and wool, and \\\"sparkUng with lichens\\\" affixed to the outside, it affords access by one hole only, on the upper part of one side, to the inside most warmly lined with feathers. So 6(5 ~ BllITISH BIRDS, TITXni EGGS AND NESTS. thoroughly is it secured to the sticks which support it, that it is scarcely possible to obtain an entire one without cutting i.lie sticks for removal also. The eggs are often ten in number, and sometimes one or two more, wTiite, and very slightly specked with red, if at all. Wliat the little bird does with her long taD when sitting, is a marvel. The young, when able to fly, kecf. much together and with their parents ; and often, when at rest, sit very close together on one branch, so as to present a doubtfullooking feathery lump to the observer's eye. \\u2014 Fig. 17, plate III. 76. BEARDED TITMOUSE.\\u2014 (Par\\u00ab5 biarmicus). The male of this species ia, indeed, a beautiful bird. They ar& met with in sufficient abundance in many districts in England, e.g., about the Norfolk Broads, the Meres in adjacent counties, as well as in Surrey and Middlesex. Until lately, from the fenny nature of the soil of their habitat, they have been less observed than any other birds ; but now their habits are much better known. Their nest is often made of various finer sedges and the dead flag-like leaves of the reed with a little grass, and lined with the seed-down of the reed. Sometimes almost on theground, sometimes raised a little above it in a tuft of grass or reeds, on the margin of a ditch or other water, it contains four to six eggs, not so large as those of the Greater Titmouse, and of usual Titmouse colour and markings. \\u2014 Fig. 1 S, plate III.

GREY-HEADED AVAGTAIL. 67 VII. MOTAClLLIDJi:. 78. PIED WAGTAIL.\\u2014 (Ifo/anV/fl alba). TVliite Wagtail, Black and TVliite Wagtail, Dishwasher, Washtail, Nanny Washtail. \\u2014 I think we, aU of us, know this familiar and very graceful bird, and like to see its active run and short flight taken for the purpose of captm-ing an insect. We have often been amused, too, at seeing perhaps a wJiole family of young ones running among the legs of the cows near the water, and taking a fly now from the belly or flank of the great animal, and then from its leg or the ground. The nest is made of grass, bents, dead roots, moss, and is sometimes found in a hole in the rude wall of an old shed or the side of a haulm wall or pile of furze, or in a hole in a bank ; sometimes on the outside of a heap of sticks, or in thatch, or upon the end of a haystack, and other analogous places. Four or five eggs are customarily found in it, white, and speckled with cinereous spots and lines, being often such as to resemble one variety of the varying eggs of the House- Sparrow. \\u2014 Fig. 19, plate III. 79. GEEY WAGTAIL.\\u2014 (i\\u00a5o/ac///\\u00ab boarula). Less plentiful than the Pied Wagtail, equally elegant and more beautiful, this little bird resembles the other in its ways and habits. Its nest is placed on the ground at no great distance from water, which has many attractions for it, as well as for the common \\\" Naimy Washtail.\\\" The materials and general structure are, in the main, the same as in the last case ; feathers and wool being introduced as a lining. There are often five or six eggs in it, of a faint white ground-colour, mottled and jtreaked with very light brown, a few streaks being sometimes of a darker tint. \\u2014 Fig. 20, plate III. SO.

Yellow Wagtail, Cow-bird. \\u2014 A summer visitor, aad, of covrse, making its nest with us. It buUds on the ground, in cornfields or fallows ; sometimes on a stump of a tree level with the grouud, or on a bank of earth overhanging water, or in a hole in a wall in the same vieinity. The said nest is made of moss, roots, dry grass, and lined with the same, only finer, and a little hair. Four to six eggs are laid, which Mr. Yarrell says, \\\" are not un like those of the Sedge-Warbler, only rather larger ; whitish in colour, mottled nearly all over with yellow-brown and ashbrown.\\\" VIII.\\u2014 ANTIIIDiE. 82. TREE PIPIT.\\u2014 (^\\u00ab;/i\\u00ab5 arboreus). Pipit Lark, Pield Titling, Field Lark, Tree Lark, Grasshopper Lark. \\u2014 No long time elapses after the spring arrival of the Tree Pipit before he makes his presence observable by indulging in his peculiar mode of recommending his song, not unpleasant in itself, to our notice. Seated on the topmost twig of a tree or high busli he sings awhile, and then up he goes with fluttering wing, singing all the while, and also while descending from his greatest height on outstretched wing to the twig he started from. The nest is always on the ground, and not far from a hedge, or under a low bush, and is found also in woods or nurseries not far from the edge of a drive or glade. It is made of moss and fibres and grass, Ihied with finer grass and a little fiair. The eggs vary inconceivably in tint and marks, and entirely baflle description. Some are purple-red, others yellowishwhite in ground, clouded and spotted almost all over with different shades of Ki^Gyish brown. \\u2014 Fiij. 22, 23, plaie III. KOCK npii. 69 83.

Meadow Lark. \\u2014 A verv common bird here, both in the enclosed lands and especially on the moors. It is amusing to observe how they sometimes wind their way among the Img, instead of flying from the place at which they have alighted. Its nest is always on the ground, sometimes in the middle of a grass or corn-Geld, sometimes nearer the hedge, but always so placed as to be very well if not very closely concealed. One I found accidentally on the moor was in the side of a cavity left by the extraction of a huge surface block of stone, in a kind of small hollow or recess, and completely covered in by earth and ling. In addition to its five proper eggs, this nest contained a Cuckoo's tg'^. The nest is made of bents, lined with the same and some hairs. Tlie eggs are from four to sLx, and vary in colour. Mr. Yarrell's descri|)- tion is, \\\" of a reddish Iwown colour, mottled over with darker brown.\\\" The red is hardly discoverable, if at all, in some I have, and I should have said \\\"dusky brown.\\\" \\u2014 Fig.2\\\\, plate III. 84.

It is seldom met with far inland, and is not always found near rocks, notwithstanding its name. It is a ground-builder, and where there are rocks handy, the nest is very likely to be oa their ledges, if only a little grass or the like grows there. It is composed of various diy grasses, and contains four or five eggs of a greenish cast, and mottled with dusky brown or da'is cinereous markings. 85. RICHARD'S '^lVlT.\\u2014{Anthus Ricardi).

Lark, Field Lark, Lavrock. \\u2014 Very few words of description are requisite in the case of tliis everywhere famihar and favouiite Bongster. Up in the sky, and soaring still, he pours out his joyous strains, suggesting to us much more forcibly than any other bird does in its song the thought that it is offering praise and thanks to Him who made and preserves the fowl that fly in the air, as well as all other creatures. So that the thought in the old German Hymn, \\u2014 \\\" Hark ! Hark ! the Lark at Heaven s gate sings,\\\" seems not fanciful to us, but solemn truth. Once last summer 1 \\u25a0was speaking the solemn words, \\\" dust to dust, ashes to ashes,\\\" over a dead parishioner, followed as they so soon are by the telling of our \\\" sm-e and certain hope of a joyful resurrection,\\\" when a Sky Lark, right over our heads, broke out into his sweet, simple, thankful, hopeful, joyous melody, and by it spoke to more sad hearts than one in that sQent company. Up, up, to the skv was Ids pathway, and the song and the soaring both said tliat a \\\"joyful resurrection\\\" was no \\\" cunningly devised fable.\\\" The Sky Lark's nest is always on the ground, often near the edge of a furrow, sometimes near a little grassy unevenness of the surface, sometimes even, cunningly concealed in a dry grassy grip by the side of a field at the foot of a low hedge-bank. It is but a slight and inartificial structure, of bents lined with finer grasses and a few fibrous roots. The eggs, which I never knew WOOD LAHK. 71 to exceed five in number, vary as much in general colour and markings as the Tree Pipit's and quite baffle verbal description. I found three in a nest two years ago, altogether dusky in general iiue and so dark that I can hardly use the word brown in describing the shade ; wliile generally \\\" dark grey\\\" and \\\" ash brown \\\" will succeed in conveying an idea of the mottliugs characterising the egg. Besides which, by no means a small proportion of a large collection of Sky Lark's eggs wUl always be found to show a prevaiUng tinge of green in the sui-face colouring. The Lark is a very faitliful mother, and will not easily be induced to leave her nest ; and even when the nest has become quite untenable longer, from any cause, the parent birds have been known to move both eggs and young to a safer place, by grasping them with the long prehensile claws of their feet. \\u2014 Fi^. 24, plaie III. 88. TYOOD LARK\\u2014 (Ala uda ardorea). The Sky Lark is seen everywhere; on the moors here in small parties, on the Saltings ia Essex and other southern counties, in our meadows and corn-fields all over the kingdom. The TVood Lark, on the other hand, is strictly local, though sufficiently abundant where it does occur. I knew, in one case, where a shot was fired at a lot of Larks in the snow, that out of five or six which were kiUed all but one proved to be Wood Larks. So local is it, that though I have been a resident in Essex, Suffolk, Cambridgeshire, Herefordshire, Berwickshire, anc' Yorkshire, as well as a visitor in other counties, I have never lived among or near its haunts, saving ordy in the western-most county named. The nest is formed on the ground, usually well concealed by grass or a neighbouring scrubby bush, is composed of dry grass and moss, and lined with fibres and a few hairs. The eggs are four or five in number, of a lighter ground-colour (but 12 BRITISH I3I11DS, THEIR EGGS AND NESTS. scurcely less ia size) than those of the Sky Lark, vary very little comparatively in their general appearance, and often in addition to the ash brown or greenish hue of the superficial frecklings and mottlings, are marked by the presence of a few wine-red blotches. Tlie young are much sought for to keep in cages, as they soon begin to sing very freely. The song of the Wood Lark in a state of nature is one of the sweetest, in some respects, with wliich I am acquainted. \\u2014 Fi_^. ^o, plate III. 89. SHORT-TOED 'LK^Y.\\u2014{Alatida hrachydadyla).

Tawny Bunting, Mountain Bunting, Snow-flake or-fleck. \\u2014 Only a winter visitor in tliis country, though often coming in not very scanty numbers. I have frequently seen tlicm on our North Yorkshire moors, and liave heard of tliem as seen in flocks of large dimensions. One informant told me he had seen as many as two hundred together. It breeds in countries very far to the North, and, like otlier indigenes of the North, is subject to considerable variations in colour according to season. So much so, that the bii'd which used to be called Tawny Bunting in its summer plumage, was re-christened by the name of Snow Bunting, to suit its winter dress, wliile the young bird was called by tlio name of Mountain Bunting. 92. COMMON BUNTING\\u2014 (ff^/im^a miliaria). Bunting, Coi-n Bunting, Ebb. \\u2014 The name of this bird shows BLACK-HEADED BUNTING. 73 that it is not by any means rare in perhaps most of our country districts. It often utters its not very musical cry seated on a tall spray in a hedge, and sometinies wliile flying along. The nest is always made very near the ground, if not actually on it, usually among stunted bushes or coarse herbage. It is made of roots, bents or coarser materials yet, and lined M-ith hair. The Bunting lays four or five eggs, of a kind of stained- white ground, suggesting the idea that a vinous-red stain has been imperfectly washed off, and blotched and streaked and speckled, in the characteristic Bunting style, with sliades of purplish brown, some of them rather dark. Though called Com Bunting, it may be found where corn-fields are not abundant. I once met with a nest at the foot of St. Abb's Head.\\u2014 /'/y. 1, plate IF. 93. BLACK-HEADED 'm'^Tm(j<\\u2014{Emberizascha-niclus). Reed Sparrow, Reed Bunting, Water Sparrow, ]\\\\Iountain Sparrow, Black-bonnet. \\u2014 Not a rare bird anywhere in England, I believe, where water is not rare ; and very conspicuous from the dark head and bright plumage of the male. On the Essex marshes it is common enougli, and so it is in the marshy or illdrained meadows of other counties. Mr. Yarrell says the \\\" nest is jreneraUy placed on tlie ground, among coarse long grass or rushes, at the foot of a thorn, or on the side of a canal bank.\\\" The last I found was among, and sapported by, the sedges growing at the side of a marsh-ditch in Essex, and not less than ten or twelve inches from the bank \\u2014 a site which I believe is not an unusual one. It is made of grasses, fragments of rushes, stalks of diffcTcnt plants, and lined sometimes with rred-dowm, or finer grasses and a little moss. I dislodged the male l)ird from the nest just named, and the eggs were perfectly warm to tiie touch. They would have been hatched in a few days. It was 74 BRITISH BIRDS, TU\\u00a3IR EGGS AND NESTS. thus proved that the male E,eed Bimting takes his share in sitting, and tlie position of the nest among green and growing sedges adds one more fact to what is known of its nidiflcation. The eggs are four or five in number, of a pale reddish-brown colour, streaked and spotted with dark brown of a rich purple shade. \\u2014 Eig. 3, plate IF. 94. YELLOW HAMMER\\u2014 (^;/i^mz\\u00ab citrmella). Yellow Bunting, Yellow Yowley, Gold-spink, Yellow teldi-ing, Yellow Yoldriug, or Yeorling, Yeldrock, Yellow Yite, Yoit, &c. \\u2014 I used to hear in Berwickshire, that \\\" The Brock, the Toad, and the Yellow YeOrling, Get a drap o' the Deil's bluid ilka May morning.\\\" I wonder what they all do with it, and how the plentiful bleeding affects the patient. Por there is certainly no lack of Yellow Hammers all over the country ; and if one looks at the long strings of blown birds' eggs festooned at cottage doors, or hung over the cottage or farm-house mantel-piece, the trophies of some yotuig nest-taking hopeful dwelling there, after the Blackbirds' and Thi-ushes' eggs, the most abundant are almost always those of the Yellow Hammer. We all know his rich plumage and somewhat plaintive song, which, in my school-boy days, used to be Englished into \\\" A very, very little bit of bread and n-o-o c-h-e-e-e-s-e ! \\\" It does not spare materials when engaged in building its nest. Dead grass, small sticks and moss, a fcT? feathers and plentiful hair to form the lining, are ready enough in our fields for its use, and the structure compacted with them is placed usually in a low, thick bush on a hedge-bank, well concealed, and but little raised above the soil. Sometimes I have found it in a rough grass-field, amid tufts of rushes and other such-like growth. Sometimes even in a wall-tree, as in my own ;;uden last year ; or in an evergreen shrub, also in my garden a CHAFFINCH. /5 year or two since. But the hedge side is the rule. The eegs, tiiree to fh'e in number, and often very round in shape, vary considerably in individual cases, but never so much as to leave the accustomed eye in a moment's doubt as to what bird the egp; belongs to. Of a white ground-colour, scarcely tinged at ali with vinous red, or perhaps much suffused, all of them are streaked and veined and spotted with dark, brown with a shade of red in it. They are beautiful eggs to my eye. \\u2014 Fig. 3, plate IK. 95. GIRL BUNTING\\u2014 (^;;<imr\\u00ab cirlus). French Yeliow Hammer, Black-throated YeUow Hammer. \\u2014 A bird long overlooked by our native ornithologists, and perhaps more frequently occurring than is even yet suspected. Still it is by no means a very common bird, \\u2014 though identified as occurring in, perhaps, most of the southern counties. Tlie Rev. Orpen Morris, from whose work on British Bnds and Eggs 1 have taken the two provincial names given above, says, \\\" the ne&t is placed in furze or low bushes, and is usually made of dry stalks of grass and a little moss, liued -uith hair and small roots. Some are wholly without moss or hair . . . the small roots constituting the Uning. The eggs are four or five in number, of a dull, bluish white, streaked and speckled with dark brown.

It would be a shame if he, with his gay dress and handsome appearance, were the bachelor he is called in his Latin name. It is, however, only at one period of the year that the sexes in the Cliaffinch tribe (as in many other kinds of birds) separate. The song of tlie Cliaffinch, though not of great compass or variety, is very cheery and sweet, and very different from his melancholy sound of \\\" Weet, weet,\\\" which many country people take as a prognostication of rain ; \\u2014 whence his local name of Wet-bird. The nest, always in a tree-fork or bush or hedge, always firmly and securely built in, always contrived and fashioned with a wonderful compactness, neatness and beauty, is formed of mosses, with various-shaded lichens on the surface, and lined with wool and hair and feathers, the last two being the finishing substances. I never knew more than five eggs to be laid, oftener four, of a peculiar winy-red dun, spotted and streaked \\u2014 and most near the large end\\u2014 with a rich, dark Sienna brown. The eggs in their comeliness befit the nest, and the nest is worthy of the bird. The female is, however, tlie principal, if not the sole, architect and bailder. \\u2014 Firj. b, j^laie IF. 98.

TREE SPA\\\"RROW\\u2014 (P\\u00ab55er montjims). Mountain Sparrow. \\u2014 This sneoios has undoubtedly been long HOUSE SPAKROW. 77 and continually confounded with the Common or House Sparrow. And even yet it has not been satisfactorily proved to have occurred in much more than half a dozen counties in England. Further observation may do more yet in identifying the Tree Sparrovr and defining its localities. It nests in holes in pollard or otlier trees, or in thatch, in company with other Sparrows of the common species, but in this case always in holes entered from the outside, not from the inside of tlic roof of the building. Sometimes it has been ascertained to breed in nests made within deserted nests of a Magpie, or some such bird. The nest, like that of the Common Sparrow, is formed of dry grass or hay, or flue straw, and abundantly lined with feathers of all sorts. ITie eggs, four or five in general, are distinctly less than those of the House Sparrow, and with more decided brown in the markings on the ground-colour of soiled white. \\u2014 Fig. 6, jilate IV. 100. HOUSE S7AKR0W\\u2014 {Passer domesticus). Sparrow, Common Sparrow. \\u2014 He may well be called the Common Sparrow, for we find him alike in the town and the country, in the field and in the garden, by the road-side hovel or in the neighbourhood of the great mansion. And whether he be sooty and blacK with the smoke of mid-London, or with his colours pure and unsmirched and bright as in the clear breezy village, he *\\u25a0 is stiU always the same pert, impudent creature, whose name has passed almost into a proverb for bold familiarity. Ubiquitous as he is by habit and system, his nest is found in sites almost as various and as numerous us, the places of his residence. Under the tUes or eaves of buildings, in the thatch-edges of a bam, in holes in the interior of a thatch-roof, in water-pipes and receivers for eaves-gutters, in holes in walls or old buildings, in ivy clothing either a wall or a tree, in fir trees, in wall-trees, especially if large and high, below Rooks' nests, in deserted ucsls of large 78 BRITISH BIRDS, TUEIR EGGS AXD NESTS. birds, \\u2014 frequent in all these sites, it seem diflicult to say where it may not be found. Often, too, it becomes a mass of straw and dry grass and lavish feather-lining, big enough to fill a man's hat of large size. The eggs are very various in the intensity of their surface markiugs. They are white, speckled and spotted and streaked with ash colour and dusky brown, some so slightly as to be pale grey, others so profusely as to be very dark \\\" pepper and salt.\\\" They vary in number from four to sis. Whenever the nest is bmlt in a situation naturally open at top, it is domed over by the little constructor. \\u2014 Fig. 7, plate IF. 101. GKSiE^l^mCR\\u2014^Coccothrauites chloris). Green Grosbeak, Green Linnet, Green Bird. \\u2014 A sufficiently common species, and often seen in wiater, in stubbles wliich afford a sufficiency of the seed-constituents of its food, in large flocks. Neither does it yield an insignificant portion of the egg spoUs of the country-boy. The nest is usually built in a hedge, and it dearly loves a thick massive thorn hedge for the purpose. In one such, bordering an orchard in Essex, of perhaps seventy or eighty yards long, I found one day a dozen or more of Greenfinches' nests, almost aJl with eggs in. It is, however, not seldom to be met with in an evergreen or other bush in tne garden ; sometimes in a fir tree, and again in a fruit or ornamental tree. The materials employed are roots, moss, grass, with a lining of the same, only finer, and plentiful hair. I have often noticed the presence of a kind of scrubby scales about the interior of one of their nests. The eggs are four, five, or six. in number, and vary much in size and but little in general appearance. They are white, suffused with a bluish tinge, and with reddish or purple spots and streaks, intermingled with some of a darker shade. \\u2014 Fig. 8, plate IV. GOLDFINCH. 73 102.

It is not uncommon about Epping Eorest, and has been found nearer London, and in many of the Southern counties. Mr. Doubleday has given the best account of its habits generally, as well as of its nest and eggs. It seems to have no peculiar situation for its nest preferred to all others, but builds indiscriminately in trees or bushes, and at various heights from the ground. The nest is said to be made of twigs, \\\" with fibrous roots and grey lichens laid flat on them;\\\" the whole structure being such as to remind one of the Ring-dove's flat platform of a nest. The eggs \\\" vary from four to six, and are of a pale olivegreen, spotted with black, and streaked with dusky grey.\\\" ]\\\\Ir. Doubleday adds, that some are much less marked than others.

It is much sought after for keeping in cages, and is caught for that purpose in numbers by the professional bird-catchers. It builds a beautifully neat and pretty nest ; sometimes in a bush or evergreen, often in the fork of an apple or other fruit-tree, and more rarely m a hedge. It is formed of moss, fir-needles, green bents, wool, thistle-dowTi, willow-down, feathers, hairs, &c., according to the choice afforded by the locality of the nest. The eggs are four or five in number, are bluish white or pale grey, spotted 80 BRITIsn BIRDS, TUER EGGS AND NESTS. with greyish purple and red bro^ni, and sometimes a little streaked with the same. \\u2014 Fig. 10, plate IV. 104.

The male in his full plum.age, with red poll and rose breast and bright brown plumage, is a handsome bird, and, compared with the female or the young, a very \\\" fine bird\\\" indeed. It is common enough in most districts, and pretty sui-e to be met with where there is much furze. The nest is frequently to be found in the midst of thick furze covers ; but like Mr. Ilewitson, I have found it commonly in thickish thorn-hedges, and very often in small and single furze bushes. It is made of small twigs and bents and moss, and often lined with a copious cushion of woo) merely; at other times, with some hair and vegetable down. The eggs vary greatly in size, as well as in colour and markings, but usually they are of a pale bluish-white ground, speckled with red of different shades, brown to pui-ple. They are four, five, and sometimes six in number. \\u2014 Fig. 11, plate IF. lOG. MEALY IlEDPOLE\\u2014 (Zjwoifa canetcens).

Common Redpole, Lesser Red-headed Finch, Rose Linnet. \\u2014 Ttiis is a winter visitor to the southern counties of England ; but remains all the year round in Scotland and some parts of north England. The nest seems to be built in some situation not too high above the ground ; for instancej in a bush or stunted tree ; and is made of moss and bents, and like some of those of the Common Linnet, with wiUow-down and the like. There are usually four or five eggs deposited in it, their colour \\\" pale bluish green, spotted with orange-brown, and principally at the larger end.\\\" The ground colour seems to vary to greenith-grey, and the spo*s to become more of a reddish tinge. \\u2014 Fi/j. 12, plate IV. 108.

It is known to breed in Yorkshire and the northern English counties as well as in Scotland, the Hebrides, &c. As its name leads one to infer, it is usually found in the neighboui-hood of hill or fell. The nest is built on the ground, among the short benty grass of the hiU-side or the dwarf ling of similar localities, or even among longer heather, and is made of the materiab afforded by such herbage, and moss, and lined with fibrous roots, wool and hair. The eggs vary from four to six in number, are ahnost white with the faintest blue or green tinge, spotted with red, brown or dark purple, with sometimes a few streaks of a lighter red tinge. \\u2014 Fig 13, plate IF. 109.

The Bullfinch is also one of those birds who have long been laid under proscription, for the mischief he is assumed to do to the buds of fruit trees. Lilvc as rewards used to be customarily paid in hosts of places out of the Parish funds for the heads of SpaiTOws, Tomtits, &c., so has it been on a lesser scale with our present birds, and I cannot help thinking equally unjustly. No doubt the \\\" Olph\\\" commits sad apparent havock on the blossom-buds ; but I suspect the blossom-buds damaged by him (as it seems) would never have come to anything if no Bullfinoh had ever been near them. There was a grub in each of tliem, and that grub would have destroyed the bud quite as effectually, if not qmte as summarily, as the bird which extracted it from what was alike its hiding-place and scene of active ravage and consumption. Unlike the Ping Dove and Missel Thrush, and a few other birds, which are usually very wild and shy, but at breeding time lay aside their wildness and distrust, and come to the close neighbourhood of human habitations to nest, the Bullfinch, in spring, leaves our gardens and orchards and resorts to the woods and wilds. The nest is made of twigs and roots and moss, rather loosely constructed, and lined with wool and hair, and is most commonly placed in a good thick bush of considerable height Mid size ; sometimes on a fir or other tree. The hen-bird lays four or five eggs of a pale greenish blue, streaked and spotted M-ith purple-red, chiefly at the larger end. \\u2014 Firj. 1^, plate IF. 110.

This is a bird which deserves a little notice at our hands on two or tliree grounds. In its plumage it varies more, according to sex or age, than perhaps any other English bii'd in a state of nature. It is kideed subject to almost startling dissimilarity. The peculiar shape and action of the bill is also noteworthy, and the strengtli of the muscles which move the mandibles may be judged of by the powerful effect produced m startiag the scales of the strongest fir-cones. Again, it has been repeatedly met mth in this country in large numbers ; and not only so, out at such seasons as to render it almost positive, that it must have nested, or be nesting here : nay even females which were obtained showed, by the state of their plumage, that they must have been so engaged : and yet until recently, no authentic observation has been recorded of the actual occurrence of its nest and eggs. It is now believed to breed in the very earliest spring or indeed in winter, which may account for the obscurity hiiherto attending its nesting habits. The nest is made of twigs below, with grassy bents upon such foundation, bound together with wool and lined with hair. The eggs seem to vary much in colour, showing a sensible degree of resemblance to those of the Greenfinch, but with a generally warmer tint, and spots of a much more decided or dark red shade. \\u2014 Fig. 15, plate IF. 112.

Common Starling, Stare, Sheep-stare, Solitary Tlirush, BroAnti Starling. \\u2014 Ttie two last of these names used to be applied to the young of the Starling. Tew cases of more brUliant Tihimage are met with in our English birds than in the instance of the male of the Common Starling. The metallic glow and play of colours in the feathers of his head, neck and back is very beautiful. It is a very abundant bird, and it is supposed by some that there are some peculiarities in its breeding habits. I mean that I have heard it asserted that the male is a polygamist, or rather perhaps a bigamist. I never saw any thing within my own scope of observation which led me to suspect it, but rather to hold the received belief that the Starling pairs exactly as most other birds do. They are exceedingly pertinacious in adhering to their clioice of a place for nesting in. I knew one case in which from the inconvenient nature of the nest-site selected, one of the birds was shot. In a very short space the survivor had paired again, and the gun again dissolved the union. The whole process was repeated five or six times, and the Starlings bred at last in the place chosen by the original pair. The nest is found in a great variety of situations, \\u2014 in the bowl of a water pipe from the eaves of a house, in a dove-cot, in holes in trees, below the nests in a rookery, in holes in old buildings or more recent masonry, between the slates and underdrawing of a roof, in holes in steep high rocks, in chimneys of houses, and the like. It is made, without stint of materials, of straw, roots, grass, and a plentiful lining of feathers. The eggs, four to six in number, vary strangely in size but not in colour, which is of a uniform pale blue. In some districts where the Starling abounds, they collect in huge flocks, the youn^' HAVEN. 85 with the parents, and may be seen when on the wing like a cloud from a great distance. \\u2014 lig. 1, plate V. 11\\u00a3 KOSE-COLOURED PASTOR\\u2014 CPas^r roseus).

Its abiding and building place is among the steep rocks which line so many parts of the British coasts. In the Isle of Wight, in Man, on the Cornish shores, at Flamborough, in Berwickshire near St. Abb's Head, it is still (or was till lately) knou-n to breed. \\\"This bird,\\\" says Mr. YarrcU, \\\"makes a nest of sticks lined with wool and hair, in the cavities of high cliffs, or in old castles, or church towers near the sea ; laying four or five eggs of a yellowish white colour, spotted with ash-grey and light brown.\\\" \\u2014 Fig. 2, flnte V. 117.

In this district, where, I believe, these biids abounded half a century since \\u2014 the rocky cliffs of om- moorland solitudes being so well suited to their Habits, \\u2014 I do not know that I have seen or heard one for the last two or tiu-ee years. Persecuted by the gamekeeper, sought after for domestication, or their eggs taken for sale to the collector, they are becoming very rare in many a part of the country where not long Bince they were frequently seen. They build sometimes on old ruins 86 BRITISH BIRDS, THEIR EGGS ANI> NESTS. or craggy precipices, but oftener in a tree, piling nest after nest in successive years upon the same bough, whence the chosen trco soon comes to be called the \\\" Raven-tree.\\\" One such accumulation of nests I knew, as a boy, in Essex, and after a stiff cUmb succeeded, in reaching it. I did it in jeopardy however, for the Ravens were very bold, and every moment I expected they would assail me, ia spite of the short bludgeon I had suspended to my wrist. Ths appearance below the nest of the farmer in whose fields the Raveu tree grew, decided the question \\u2014 perhaps he frightened tlie Ravens as weU as threatened me ; perhaps they knew he came as their protector \\u2014 anyhow I did not get my egg, although I had actually liad it in my hand. The nest is a great pile of sticks, lined with wool and roots and felts of hair, and often has four or five eggs laid in it, of a light green ground-shade, blotched and spotted with browns of varying depth of colour, but some of them very dark. \\u2014 Fig. 3, Tplate V. 118. CROW\\u2014 {Cort;a* corone).

Waterton calls him his \\\" Warrior bird\\\"), and a young and weakly lamb, a young Hare or Rabbit, a wounded or frightened Partridge has little or no chance with him. I knew a case a year or two since of a Crow attacking a Partridge and driving it to cover in a hedge, where it lay so terrified and exliausted as to suffer itself to be picked up by a spectator. I knew another instance years ago iu which the Crow attacked a young Rabbit. The old doe came to the assistance of her young one, and the 'oattle was well contested, but tlie Crow was the victor, and carried off the spoil. ROCK. 87 Paired once, these birds, as in the case of the Raven, are paii-ed for good. The nest is placed in a main fork of a large tree, and is made of sticks and twigs with abundant cushioning of wool and hair. It is believed not to bmld a new nest every year. It lays four or five eggs, varying much in the depth of the tiut of the greenish ground-colour, and generally weU mottled and blotched and spotted with greenish ash colour and bright brown. The parents seem to expel their young from the immediate precincts of their own abode very soon after they are able to provide for themselves ; as is the case with the Raven also. \\u2014 Fig. 4, 'plate V. 119.

It has been very seldom known to breed in England, though coming m great abundance from its more northern haunts before the access of winter. In north and west Scotland, the Hebrides and Orkneys it breeds in large numbers, and rewards for its destruction have been customarily paid to within a recent period, if indeed they have altogether ceased yet. They place their nests among rocks, in the rifts or on ledges. These are built of ling, sticks, roots, stalks of plants, seaweed ; and lined with wool and hair. There are usually four or five eggs, not differing very materially in colouring from those of the Common Crow. \\u2014 Fig. 5, flate V. 120. ROOK\\u2014 ( Corrws frugilegus) .

In the country some of the most familiar sights aud sounds are those afforded by the Rookery, or by tlie huge assemblages of Rooks about the fields or winging their morning or evening lliglit in quest of food, or in return to their domiciles. Most of us too have heard of Rook courts of justice, and the sentences awarded against the ^vrongful spoilers of a neighbour's nest, as well as the battles to resist such an invasion. It is ce?-tauily a remarkable instinct, wliich, to so great a degree, forbids birds building in communities to pliuider the building materials placed on the adjoining bough or ledge, and no wonder that Instinct has provided a remedy for what must be looked upon, when it occurs to any extent, as a somewhat unnatural offence. The Rook resorts to the same nest year after year, merely making such repairs as a year's wear and tear from wind and rain and accident nave rendered necessary. When the nest is ready, four or five eggs are deposited, of a greenish ground-colour more or less intense in shade, plentifully mottled and blotched with darker \\u2022jnd varying shades of brownish green. Many of the eggs strongly resemble tliose of the Crow, while others are much more like those of the Jackdaw. As in the case of the Bullfinch tlie Rook is often blamed for doing mischief which was really done by the creature which formed tlie real object of search to the supposed offender. The wireworm and the grub of the cockchafer do infinite damage in grass or cornfields by eating ofi the roots of the plants in question. Tiie Rook pulls up these ruined plants ajid eats the offending larva. The farmer or supcrucial observer only sees the dead grass or com plant, and loolishly accuses the Rook, and persecutes him, though in reality a friend and benefactor, to the death. Not but what the Rook does niLseblef at times ; for I have often seen newly sown corn-fields MAGPIE. 89 black with them, and have bccu coutiuually a witness to the very extensive damage done to the potato crop just when the young tubers were in most active growth and most susceptible of harm. Still, a few precautions will suffice to protect both cornlejQ and potato-crop during the brief space while protection is necessary, and the balance of good done is so greatly on the preaoininaling side, that the Rook may well continue to be protected. Rook shooting has charms for many. For myself I seem to see cruelty so conspicuous about the whole process, that I cannot conceive in what the pleasure consists. \\u2014 'Eig. 6, ]plata V. 121.

They breed in many places in the immediate neighbourhood of my residence in very considerable numbers, in the holes and crevices which abound among craggy rocks and precipices that rise high above steep wooded banks. Besides, they build in ruinous buildings, in church towers of pigeon-houses, in little used chimneys, in holes in modern masonry, even in deserted chambers. The pile of materials amassed is simply wonderful, and really they are sometimes so laid together as if intended to serve no other purpose but to lengthen out the nest-pile for a builder's amusement. Sticks and wool are the substances usually employed, and the eggs laid vary, as to number, between three and sii. They are of a pale bluish-white, well spotted with ash colour light brown and dark brown. \\u2014 lig. 7, plate V. 122. IklAGPIE\\u2014 (PiVa cauda(a).

It is almost idle to say no such variety or distinction really exists. The materials of the nest are cliiefly sticks, plastered with earth inside, and lined with roots and hair. There are often as many as six or seven eggs laid in it, pale bluish-white in colour, spotted all over, and abundantly so in general, with grey and greenish brown of more than one shade. \\u2014 Fi/g. 8, plate V. 123. JAY \\u2014 {Garrulus glandarius).

It is a shy bii'd, seldom, seen far from its haunts in woods and copses, though when seen, it is noticeable enough from a certain peculiarity in its flight, due to a sort of fluttering use or motion of its wings. It is easily domesticated, and b?.conics a tame and amusing pet. The nest is very often extremely rude and inartificial, almost as much so as the Ring Dove's. It is placed in the upper part of a lofty bush in a wood, or on some one of the lateral oranches of a tree where the height from the ground is considerable'; is made of sticks and GREEN WOODPECKER. 91 liued with roots ; the cavity containing the eggs often seeming to be not very considerable.

I have no idea of the origin or etymology of either form, but I have given these names generally in the thought that they may be helpful to some, and interesting to other young egg-collectors. The Green Woodpecker is the most common, and much the best known of all our English Woodpeckers. Besides being a very handsome bird, its organization (as is indeed the case with aU the tribe) is so beautifully adapted to its mode of life, as to merit a brief notice at our hands. Its strong prehensile feet and claws, two toes being directed forward and two backwards, fit it not only for moving in all directions, and with wonderful readiness and ease in any direction whatever, about the trunk or limbs of a tree, but also for grasping the surface with great tenacity when necessity arises 92 UKITISII BIIIDS, TUEIK KGGS AND NESTS, for applying its strong bill to penetrating or disloding either bark or portions of the wood itself. When thus occupied, the tail comes into use, and the bones at the lower extremity of the skeleton are so formed as to enable the stifT, pointed tail-feathers to be appHcd to the tree in such a way as to strengthen the purchase already obtained by the firm foot-hold. Add to all this the length of the tongue, its great extensibility, specially provided for by a peculiar arrangement of muscles, together with the structure of the tongue itself \\u2014 remarkable for its sharp, horny tip and barb like bristles on either side near the point \\u2014 and we Lave one of Nature's most beautiful accommodations of means to the intended end which can well be offered to our admiring notice . The undulating flight and laugh-like cry of the Green Woodpecker used to be more common than they seem to be now, and the great multiplicity of provincial names seems to show that once it must have been an exceedingly common bh-d. I have rarely seen or heard it here : and no wonder. For where once there were mUcs of forest, now we have scarcely 100 acres of wood in the whole district. This Woodpecker's cry is loudly and frequently uttered befoie unpending rain ; whence one of its common or by-names. It breeds in holes in trees, which it often excavates in part or enlarges to suit its wants. It makes no nest, but deposits its eggs, four to seven in number, and perfectly white, on a bed of the soft decayed wood of the tree. The eggs average rather over l|-inchin length, by about |-inch broad. Ko LUustration being possible in ouj: space of purely white eggs I tliink it better to append their measurements. 127.

It is less likely, too, to betray its presence by its note than the Green Woodpecker, and is so shy and so capable of, concealing itself or keepim:^ the tnink of a tree always between itself and any prying observer, that doubtless it is deemed to be more rare than it reully is. It seems to prefer the vicinity of woods, but may be seen occasionally where woods do not abound, and sometimes even it resorts to places where abundance of old posts or decaying tree-trunks lead it to expect a plentiful repast. It breeds ia holes in trees, making no nest, and laying its four or five eggs on just such a bed as its green namesake.

It is said to prefer large woods of Beech ; and like the other Woodpeckers, makes no nest, but places its eggs in a hoUow tree, accessible by only a small hole, the means of access being often at a considerable distance from the eggs laid below. The eggs of this little bird are four or five in number, purely white, though seeming to be suffused with a delicate pink hue before they are blown, which arises from the transparency of the ihell. They are about l-inch long by rather more than |-inch broad. 129. ^YRYKF.CK~(runx torquilla).

We willingly pardon its want of melody for its associations.

They are from six to ten in number, and white and glossy, and about the same size as those of the Barred Wood-pecker. The old bu-d is singularly unwilling to leave her eggs under any intrusion, and tries by such means as hissing sharply, elevating her crest and contorting her neck, to intimidate or deter the intruder. II.\\u2014 CERTHIADJ2. 130. CRYEVER\\u2014iCeri/iia familiaris). Tree-creeper, Tree-climber. \\u2014 A shy, gentle-seeming little bird, shunning observation, and, with the rest of its neighbours in our catalogue, possessing a singular facility of quietly and rapidly shiftuig its place on the trunlc or limb of a tree, so as always to interpose an efficient screen between its own minute body and the eye of any passer-by. Its claws, sharp and long and curved, aided by its long and pointed tail-feathers, are its chief machinery in these facile motions. It builds its nest, generally speaking, in a hole in a tree, with only a very minute aperture. Sometimes, though I think rarely, the nest is outside the tree, but screened from observation by some casual dislodgement of the bark, or in some similar way. It is made of dry grass, small twigs, shreds of moss, with a lining of feathers. It is very hard to distinguish Oft between the eggs of the Creeper, which number from six to nine, and those of the Blue Tit-mouse and the Willow-wren, not to mention one or two other small birds. The illustration will give a better idea of the egg than many lines of description. \\u2014 Fij. 16, fLate IV. 131. y^^^l^\\u2014 [Troglodytes vulgaris). Jenny Wren, Kitty Wren, Titty Wren, Cutty Wren.\\u2014 A kind of natural pet with every one. I scarcely ever remember to have spoken of the Wren, or heard others speak of it, without some gentle, loving epithet applied to its name. The provincial names quoted are instances of what I mean, and how often the words \\\"poor,\\\" \\\"little,\\\" \\\"tiny,\\\" and even \\\"dear,\\\" are jomed to the ;)refixes of Jenny, or Kitty, or Titty. Its little song, its seeming incapacity to bear the rude buffets of storm and cold, its quiet peculiar movements, all tend to commend it to our kmdly notice. And then the beautiful nest it makes \\u2014 such a great pile for such a tiny builder \\u2014 and so compact and warm and wonderfully concealed by the use of the nicest adaptations of materials and design to the site selected, \\u2014 this makes us almost respectfully admire, in addition to our love. I have found it on the mosscovered bank, on the moss-covered trunk of a tree, in thatch, in a haulm wall ; but wherever it is found, the adjacent substances are made to help the concealment. One would think that when strength and ability, seemingly so inadequate, had been so heavily tasked as is implied in the construction of such a nest, the little birds would not be likely to leave it, especially with the bmlding of another in immediate prospect. But I have not found it so in practice. A very trifling enlargement of the single orifice, or straining of the fabric, in the effort to send the finger to the bottom of the nest, is quite sufficient to cause the nest to be deserted ; especially if the Wrens owning it have 9f> mUTISlf BIRDS, THEIR EGGS AND NESTS. once or more been disturbed when in it, or very near it. When the young ones are liatched, the case is altered. The eggs are often from six to nine or ten in number, and I liave heard of even more. They are white, with almost always a few pale red spots about them. The male is said to feed the female during the period of closest incubation. Many other bu'ds ccrtaiiJy have the same habit, even when the mate has left the nest just to stretch her wings, as it were. I have seen the Common Linnet do this. \\u2014 lig. 17, 'plate IV. 132.

NUT-HATCH\\u2014 (&Y^\\u00ab Europcea). Nut-jobber, \\\"VVood-cracker. \\u2014 A very beautiful bird to my eye, with liis bright slate-coloured back, and orange breast, and black bill ; and a very great pet in former days. I had a pair which had never known a day of constraint, but wliich, by patient feeding and care to make them fearless of me, became so tame as almost to take food from my hand ; to take it readily when I jerked it a foot or two into the an-. And they would always come to my signal for them \\u2014 a few blows on the tree at which I fed them. But they never suffered their young to come to the feast I provided, and always absented themselves for about a month at the breeding time. The nest is, I believe, always made in the hole of a tree, and if the aperture to the hollow is too large, the bird is apt to lessen it by the application of a sort of mud-plaster to some portions of the edge. The nest is Ci.CKOO. 97 rather a eontiast tu that, of tlic little \\\"VVrcnjust named, being little more than a loose heap of moss, small twigs, aud chips of Dark and wood.

Hearing the first Cuckoo and seeiug the first Swallow are always events to true lovers of country scenes aud objects and sounds. But what a strange instuict it is which forbids our Cuckoo to build a nest, and instructs it to lay its t^'^ \\u2014 at least to place it \\u2014 in some other bird's nest, and tha'>, bird usually not one-fifth its own size ! A Blackbird's nest is sometimes selected to receive the deposit, but very rarely compared with the Hedge Sparrow's, the Lark's, the ]\\\\Icadow Pipit's, the Water Wagtail's, or the Chaffinch's. How many eggs are laid by a single Cuckoo in a season, is, I think, not ascertained. It is, however, a very rare circumstance to find more than one Cuckoo's c^^ in any given nest, and then open to great doubt if both were placed there by the same Cuckoo. It is a matter of dispute how the ^2^^ is actually deposited in the nest selected ; whether \\\" laid\\\" in, or placed in \\u2014 after being dropped on the ground suppose \\u2014 by the bill or claws.

How IHp (\\\"'ucAno 93 BRITISU BIRDS, THEIR EGGS AND NESTS. found such a nest at all, was a marvel to me.

Beyond doubt, as far as exceeding brilliancy of plumage goes, the most beautiful of our indigenous birds. I have never seen it in any part of the kingdom a numerous bird, though in my fishing and other excursions in Suffolk, Essex, Norfolk, and Herefordshire, I used to see many pairs ; each, however, domiciled at some distance from its nearest neighbours. In the district of North Yorkshire I am best acquainted with I have never seen it. Its straight, arrow-like, speeding flight is sure to be remembeured, when once seen, and so is the odour inseparable from its nesthole or other stated haunt. A hole, sloping upwards, in the ^ank of the water it uaost frequents, whether jjond, stream. 99 marsh, dit.cii, or large river, is usually clioscu to receive the uest, which is often a foot and a half, or two feet from the entrance; but sometimes the bird has been known to resort to a hole at some distance from any water. The nest, so called, seems to be constituted of small fish-bones, ejected from the King-fisher's stomach, and the dry soil of the hole, while the eggs deposited in it are five or six in number, very round in form, beautifully white when blown, and though, from the thinness of the shell, seeming to have a pink hue before the removal of the yolk. ' III.\\u2014 HIRUNDINID^. 139. SWALLOW\\u2014 {Illniudo rustica). Common Swallow, House Swallow, Chimney Swallow, Bam Swallow. \\u2014 One of the most welcome of all our spring visitors ; and so frequently coming back, the self-same pair of birds apparently, to the self-same nest, that they seem to be almost like members of the family returnmg from a temporary absence. The common name. Chimney Swallow, is, however, rather a misnomer. No doubt they build in chimneys freely and frequently, but in many districts the chimney is quite untenanted by any Swallows, while the open roofs of sheds and barns, the under side of bridges sufficiently flat and uneven to afford the necessary support, disused shafts of mines, and the bice, and even parts of unused rooms, or articles of fui'uiture in such rooms, are resorted to. These nests are very considerably different from those of the Martin (to be noticed next), inasmuch as th(;y are always completely open above, being so built that there is a sensible space between the greater portion of tlie edge of the plaster-work of the nest, and the roof or other surface above ; whiie in the case of the Martin's nest, it is always bmlt so as to be closed above by the eaves or other ledge to which it is affixed, requiring a gap or 100 BRITIsn BIKDS, THEIR EGGS AND NESTS. lip \\u2014 SO to speak \\u2014 to be left in the wall to afford ingress and ejjress to the owners. The nest, in either case, is built with many peliets of soft tenacious earth, wrought into form with bits of straw or grass, and afterwards lined with feathers. It is observable that no more work at tlie nest is done in a day than wiU readily harden enough to bear tlie requisite additions of materials abov when the tune comes for making them. There are usually fou five, or six eggs laid; white, speckled and spotted with dee red, and a lighter duller shade, \\u2014 Fig. 20, plate IV. 140. MARIVN\\u2014iHirundo urbica).

Every one knows where to look for the Martin's nest, and many a house can we all call to mind which seems, from some peculiarity in its site or external fashion, to be particularly affected by these birds \\u2014 and certainly, in most cases, the imnates of the house take much care to save their confiding feathered friends from disturbance. In many places, however, the Martin forms large nesting colonies, which take possession of a series of overhanging ledges on some steep rocky face, and there build their nests in great numbers. In Berwickshire, on the banks of the Whiteadder, I knew of such a colony, and others elsewhere : the principal ones, however, being on the rock-bound coast between St. Abb's Head and Burnmouth. Hundreds of these birds nested in several different places upon those lofty precipices. No description of the nest itself \\u2014 beyond what was said in the notice of the Swallow \\u2014 seems requisite. The number of eggs, which are perfectly Mliite. seems seldom to exceed six.

Bank Martin, Pit Martin, Sand Swallow, Bank Swallow, River Swallow. \\u2014 This delicate little visitor cornea to us in the spring, often very early, from Africa, as do also the two others of the genus just named. Where it does occur \\u2014 and it is generally diffused \\u2014 it is often seen in very large numbers. A Ballast Pit at Fingringhoe, in Essex, is occupied by the most numerous colony I am acquainted with; and a site afforded by the surface beds of sand and sod above a steep scarp of rock on Tweed-bank, nearly opposite Norham Castle, used to accommodate another colony. Some of the holes are bored to a very great depth. I have enlarged the orifice of many tiU it would admit my whole shoulder, and liave tlien been unable to reach the termination of the gallery. Others are much shorter, and admitting of more easy access to the nest The female -will, notwithstanding the noise and violence attending the enlargement of the aperture of her nest-hole, sit resolutely on, and allow herself to be taken in the hand with scarcely a struggle or sign of resistance \\u2014 even of life, sometimes. One I took thus a year or two since lay in my open hand for a minute or more, and then at last flew only leisurely away. A little loose, soft straw, with some feathers, serves to receive tlie eggs, which are four to six in number, often much elongated in shape, of the most delicate white, and beautifully pink, from the thinness of the shell, before they are blown. 142.

It is most frequently seen at no great distance from some old tower of castle or church, or such like building, although at times it seems to range far in searcli of food. It makes its nest of pieces of soft straw, bents or grass or hay and feathers, and usually in holes in the buildings aforesaid, or between the tiles and underroof of houses ; and the nest once made is supposed to be used for many years in succession by the same pair of birds. It sometimes seems as if it had been cemented together in some way. The Swift often lays only two eggs, but has been known to produce three, and even four. They are quite white, and rather large for the size of the bird. 144. ALPINE SWlYT\\u2014iC^pselus Alpinus). White-bellied Swift. \\u2014 A bird which is known to have visited us on some lialf dozen occasions or so. IV.\\u2014 CAPRIMULGID^. 145. TsIGHT-JAR \\u2014 {Caprimuhjus Europaeus). Night Hawk, Goat-sucker, Dor Hawk, Fern Owl, Night Crow, Jar Owl, Churn Owl, Wheel-bird, Eve-churr, Night-churr, Puckeridge. \\u2014 Far more familiar to many of the comparatively few among country-dwellers who notice such matters, is the Nightjar by sound than by sight. Coming from its retirement but very little and very reluctantly by day, and only pursuing its prey towards and during twilight, it is not by any means an obtnisive bird ; as little so, indeed, as any one of the Owls. But its loud churring or jarring note, as it wheels round a tree or clump of trees, is often enough heard by many a one to whom its form and size and plumage are nearly or utterly strange. It is. perhaps, most frequently met with where patches of furze and aiXQ DOVB 103 fern on open commons, not too far from the neighbourhood of plantations, occur. The Night-jar can hardly be said to make a nest ; but hiys two eggs in any slight natural depression of the ground whicli slie can find suiBciently near a bush or clump of whins to be at least partly concealed by it. Tlie eggs are very oval in shape, and very beautifully mottled and clouded and veined with varying tints of blueish iead-colour and browr\\\\, on a whitish ground. \\u2014 Fig. I, plate VI. III.\\u2014 RASORES. FAMILY I.\\u2014 COLUMBID^. 14C. RIISIG ViOTS.\\u2014{Columha pahmhus). Wood Pigeon, Ring Pigeon, Cushat, Cusliie Doo, Queest. \\u2014 This, the first bird in the new Order of Rasores, is tolerably well known to every one the least acquainted with ordinary country scenes and objects. A fine, handsome bird, met with everywhere throughout the country, and, in many parts of it, seen in very large flocks in the winter time ; sure to attract attention, also, as \\\"we walk through the wood, by the loud ringing clap of his wings as he takes flight ; and all this independently of his plaintive nim-mur in the breeding season, soundmg very sweet and mellow as heard from a little distance \\u2014 the Wood Pigeon, or Queest, or Cushat, as he is named in different districts, is as prominent among wiM birds as the parson of the parish among his parishioners. The young birds are frequently taken from the nest and reared by hand ; and the bold, fearless, confiding familiarity of such pets, considering their extreme native shyness and wildness, is remarkable. The Ring Dove makes its rude platform nest of sticks, with a cushion of roots to receive the eggs 'j\\\\ bushes standing singly or m hedges or woods, in pollard trees, in holly or other thick trees, in evergreens in gardens, and tba l04 BRITISH BIRDS, THEIR EGGS AND NESTS. like ; and nothing is more common than to see the parent birds frequenting the garden and close vicinity of a country-house, aimost as tamely as if they were a pair of common or house Pigeons. The eggs seem to be invariably very oval in shape, and purely wliite. They are 1^ inch long, by | inch broad. 147. STOCK T)OYE\\u2014(Columba anas). Stock Pigeon, Wood Pigeon, Wood Dove. \\u2014 This Dove is not only, generally speaking, much less abundant throughout the country than the Ring Dove, but very often, it would seem, confounded with it by casual observers, who only notice the several birds from a distance, or on the wing. They frequent the same roostiug-places, and often feed in the same field, thougli probably on different species of food. I have shot birds of both species at the same discharge of the gun, and have noticed the different matters which had supplied their meals of the day, \\u2014 Hollyberries, in the case of the Ring Dove ; wild mustard-seed, in the other. The Stock Dove is, however, immediately and easily distinguishable from the Ring Dove, by its lesser size, a slight difference in colour, and the entire absence of the \\\" ring \\\" of white feathers on the neck. Its nest is placed sometimes on pollard trees, sometimes in open holes or hollows in old trees ; and very commonly, in some districts, either on the ground Ijclow tluck furze-bushes, or in deserted rabbit-burrows, two or three feet distant from the entrance. The nest is very slight, consisting merely of a few twigs or roots. The eggs are two in number* pure wliite, about or rather exceeding \\\\\\\\ inch in length, by li inch in breadth. ROCK-DOVE\\u2014 (Co&\\u00bb23a livia). Wild Pigeon, Rock Pigeon, Wild Dove, Doo, Rockier. \\u2014 This Pigeon has usually, until not long since, beec confused with the TURTLE DOVE. 105 Stock Dove. But their plumage is unlike, their voice unlike, and especially their habits and living and breeding haunts unlike. It is believed with some certainty, that the Rock Dove is the reai \\u25a0origin of the Domestic Pigeon, and certainly any one who has -seen the large flight of Domestic Pigeons turned wild, which frequent the caverns in tlie rock-bound coast near St, Abb's Head and similar localities, living with, flying with, feeding with, and nesting with the undoubted wild Rockier, can entertain but very small doubts on the subject. The Ptock Dove makes a loose nest \\u25a0of twigs and plant-stems and dry grass ; very often far back in holes and crevices of the rock ; and lays two white eggs, with a much better defined \\\" big end\\\" and \\\" little end\\\" than in the case of the two Pigeons last named. 149. TURTLE DOYl^\\u2014(Colimba turiur.) Turtle, Common Turtle, Ring-necked Turtle, Wrekin Dove. \\u2014 Only a summer visitor and not a regular inhabitant, like its three predecessors. It is long since, living where I do, I have heard its sweet, plaintive note. No one but one who loves bnds and theii ways can tell how real a deprivation it is to live for years out ol sound of the sweet and familiar voices of such as are only local, the Nightingale for instance, the Turtle, and many others. The male Tnrtle Dove is a very handsome bnd, but much shier and more retiring at breeding-time than the Ring Dove. The nest is a light platform of sticks, easily permitting the sky to be seen through it from below, and usually placed high up in a holly, a thick bush in a wood, in the branches of a fir, or the lesser fork ol some limb of an oak or other forest tree. As with tiie other Doves, the eggs are two in number, quite white, about 1| inch long, by I broad. 150. PASSENGER 71GE0'^\\u2014(Echpisies migratorius). Every bird-loving boy, beyond doubt, has heard of this Pigeon 106 BIUIISH BIRDS, THEIR KGGS AND NESTS, and the inconceivable vastness of the flocks in which they pass from one distant district to another in America. Here it is only a casual visitor, and can lawfully lay claim to none of our limited space. II.\\u2014 PHASIANID.E. 151. PHEASANT\\u2014 (P^fl\\u00ab\\u00ab\\u00ab\\u00ab5 Colchlcus). I dare say \\\"a good few\\\" of our readers if they wers asked \\\" Do you know the Pheasant ?\\\" might answer, \\\" Yes, very well. We had some for dinner, such and such a day.\\\" And I have no doubt the acquaintance was satisfactory enough \\u2014 at least to one of the parties. The Plieasant docs not pair, and on the preserved estates in Norfolk and Cambridgeshire I have frequently seen ia the spring large groups of Cock Pheasants collected and consorting together without the intermixture of a single hen. In a vast many places now an artificial system of Pheasant-breeding is adopted, three or four hens with one male beuig turned into a large paled \\\" apartment,\\\" well netted in, the whole establishment comprising many such apartments. Each hen lays double or treble the number of eggs she would if suffered to run wild, and these are collected daily and placed ujider hens ready to sit as soon as a sufficient number is got together. In this way twice or three times the number of young ones is secured from one hen as compared with her own greatest success in bringing off a brood in the woods. In her w'M state, the Pheasant makes scarcely any nest, on the ground, \\\\uA lays ten or twelve eggs, of a uniform pale olivo-brown shade. Not only are cases in which two Pheasants lay in the same nest of by no means unfrequent occui-rence, but others even, in which Pheasants' eggs have been found in Partridges' nests. Many instances are on record of the Pheasant inter-breeding with other birds, such as the Gumea Fowl, tho BLACK GROUSE. 107 Black Grouse, and the Common Fowl. The cross last named is by no means uncommon, and a remarkably fine male specimen of the produce of a Cock Pheasant and Speckled Hamburg Hen occurred here (one of four birds wiiich were hatched) a few years since. The Pheasant's tail and iiead and general shape as well as fashion of feathers (with access of size) were united to the shades and markings of the plumage of the mother. The bird in question was so inveterate in his visits to the neighbouring farm-yard in order to challenge the Cocks who dwelt there, and so sm-e to kill them outright, or maim or maul them so severely that they had to be kUled, that it became necessary to put him out of the way himself, and his present memorial is liis remarkably well-stuffed skin. \\u2014 Fit/. 2, plate VI.

Cock of the Woods, Wood Grouse, Cock of the Mountain, Great Grouse, Capercailzie, Capercally. \\u2014 An indigenous inhabitant of this country, but one which had become, or was becoming, extinct, a few years ago. Now it is becoming comparatively abundant again on the estates of several large and noble owners, principally m Scotland. It is indeed a very noble bird, and well wortliy the care and attention and expense which have been devoted to the attempt to re-establish it. The female makes her nest on the ground, and lays from six to ten or twelve eggs. These are of a pale reddish-yellow bro\\\\vn, spotted all over with two shades of darker orange brown. \\u2014 Fir/. 3, plate VI. 153. BLACK GROUSE\\u2014 (Je^rao (etria:).

In fact, the gradual and very complete demolition of the last remains of what were once very extensive forests has completely banished the Black Grouse from places where it used to be common within the memory of living men. It is a very handsome bird, and like the Capercailly and the Pheasant, does not pair. The hen makes a very slight nest on the ground, and lays in it seven to nine or ten eggs, of a somewhat less warm ground-shade than those last named, but with larger and brighter-coloured spots and blotches. \\u2014 Firj. 4:,plale VI. 154. RED d'KOV^'E\\u2014iLagopns Scoticus.) Red Ptarmigan, Red Game, Moor Game, Muir-fowl, Moorbird. \\u2014 A beautiful bird indeed, and pecuhar to the British Islands. The Grouse moors, however, are mainly confined to the nortliern counties of Eugland and Scotland. In the district in which this is written the Grouse may be truly said to abound, and I iiear them coutinually from my garden or open window.* These birds do pair, and pair very early indeed moreover. I have frequently seen them in pairs before the season for killing them, which expires on December 10, is fully out. If the weather becomes severe this union often seems to be annulled ; but I don't think it is in reality. In tlic earlier spring, when the pairing is becoming general, many fierce battles among the males may be seen going on, and very resolute and lengthened and circuitous flights of one in pursuit of another occur. The nest is very slight, of ling and bents chiefly, and usually well concealed in a tuft of heather. From six or seven up to twelve or fifteen eggs are said to be laid, but I should say that the highest average, judging from the number of young bu-ds in a brood, very rarely * For a detailud series of observations on the liahits, &c., of the Grouse, see \\\" Sketches in Natural Uistory,\\\" Routled^e & Co. COSlMON PARTRIDGE. 109 much exceeds eiglat or nine. The eggs are very beautiful and richly coloured, but vary exceedingly in both ground-colour and markings, even those found in the same nest. Some are of a yellowish shade, and others of a blood-stain red, mottled and blotched with rich umber brown, and the paler ones with shades of light-brown. \\u2014 FIq. 5, plate VI. 155. VTKKMlGK^\\u2014iLarjopus vulgaris). White Grouse, Rock Grouse, White Game \\u2014 Only found now among the rocky tops of the highest lulls and mountains in the centre and north of Scotland. It is the smallest species of Grouse in Britain, and its plumage varies greatly with the season, becoming nearly pure white in winter. It lays seven to ten eggs frequently on the bare stones. They are of a yellowish groundcolour, blotched and spotted (slightly so as compared with the eggs of the Red Grouse) with ricli dark bro\\\\vn. 156. COMMON PARTRIDGE\\u2014 (Per(//2- chierea). Much too familiar a bird by appearance, voice and flavour to require any very lengthened notice from us. The Partridge pairs pretty early \\u2014 by the end of January, often \\u2014 and once paired they never separate again throughout the season. At pairing time the cocks fight fiercely, and I have sometimes seen, and even m my garden here, three or four engaged in the conflict, with another, probably the female \\\" apple of discord,\\\" sitting quietly by the while. I have seen the male, too, in the evening, when summoning Ms newly-married wife, stand on the top of one of our stone walls and call repeatedly. The nest is made on the ground in a field of grass or corn, or on a dry hedge bank, or at the foot of a waU among the long grass, and consists of little but a slight depression in the ground, with a few dead leaves and 110 BRITISH BIRDS, THEIR EGGS AND NESTS, twenty. But it is no uncommon thing for two Partridges to laj in the same nest, and an instance came to my knowledge two oi three years since, in which a Ked-legged Partridge had laid several eggs in a Common Partridge's nest. Wlien two birds lay together thus, the covey sometimes amounts to thirty or tliirty-five birds. I knew one instance of forty, about three years since. The male Partridge is known to help his mate, when the hatch is drawing on, by sitting at her side and covering some of the eggs. \\\"VVlien there are two layings in the same nest, it is an interesting question whether the two hens sit together, or the original owner of the nest is simply assisted by her mate. The young bu'ds are able to run and \\\" fend for themselves\\\" almost as soon as they are hatched. The eggs are of a uniform pale oUvebrown hue. \\u2014 Fig. 6, plate VI. 157. RED-LEGGED PARTRIDGE\\u2014 (P^r^j> rufa). French Partridge, Guernsey Partridge. \\u2014 A much more striking bird in appearance than the Common Partridge, and said also to be a powerful enemy to it. Certainly, in districts where it has been encouraged and preserved, it seems to have prevailed to the comparative exclusion of the indigenous species. It is supposed to have been first introduced about the time of Charles II. For long it seems to have increased and spread but very slowly, but now there are many districts of the south where it is exceedingly abundant. These birds form a slight nest of dry bents and leaves upon the ground, amid some growing crop of grass or com. Instances, however, have been asserted in which the nest was a good deal elevated above the ground, as on the top of a stack. The eggs, very hard-shelled, are from ten to fifteen or sixteen in number, of a cream colour, well spotted with small speckles of reddish or cirmamon bro^vn. \\u2014 Fij. 7, plate VI. GREAT BUSTARD. Ill 158. QUAIL \\u2014 {Coturnix vulgaris). The quail is believed, in some rare instances, to stay with us all the year, but is usually only a summer visitant, not coming in any great numbers. In some countries its migratory hosts are so great that one hundred thousand are said to have been taken in a day. In its appearance, the quail strongly reminds one of the Partridge, and suggests the idea that itself is only a diminutive bird of that species. They do not, however, pair, and tlieir nests are met with in many parts of the kingdom. Two years since it was believed that at least two broods were reared on certain lauds in Moorsholm, in North Yorkshire. A small depression in the ground is made, or found, and loosely lined with bits of grass and dry stalks. Seven to ten, or possibly yet more eggs, are laid, presenting much variety of appearance, but usually of a faint cream-coloured ground, mottled and clouded in some cases with red brown, and in others spotted with dark brown spots, some of considerable size. \\u2014 Fig. 8, 'plate VI, IV.\\u2014 STRUTHIONID^. 159. GREAT BUSTARD\\u2014 (O/w larda). Tills noble bird, once abundant enough on our wide plains and wolds in England, is now, I fear, ahnost extinct among us, as so far as I am aware no very recent* capture of it has been announced. It used, before the gun became so common and sc; fatal to birds of much interest to the ornithologist or others, to be customarily pursued with greyhounds. These birds do not pair, and their nest is said to be a mere natural saucer-shapej' hole in the bare ground. The eggs are seldom more than two, or at most three, in number, and are of an oUve-green ground, \\u2022 Since this was written, one instance has occurred. 112 BRITISH BIRDS, THEIR EGGS AND NESTS. blotched aud spotted with two or three snades of brown, lighter and darker.

Stone Cm-lew, Norfolk Plover, \\\"VVliistling Plover, Stone Plover, Thick -knee. \\u2014 The Stone Curlew is a summer visitor, and strictly a local one. The Is ightingale, for instance, is very much more extensively diffused than the bird just named. It is fouud abundantly enough on the wide sandy plains of Norfolk, and 1 used to hear it very commonly in the fields a few miles to the north-west of Bury St. Edmunds. Besides the counties just named, it is met with in parts of Essex and Kent, in Hampshire, and Cambridgeshire, and two or three others. Its peculiar shrill CTj- or whistle, once heard, is not likely to be forgotten. The female lays two eggs on the bare ground, among white-coated flints and stones. An idea of their ground-colour may be given by the mention of what the painters call stone-coloui-, in pale shades, and this is streaked and spotted, or marbled, with dark brown. \\u2014 Fig. 1, plate VII. 182.* PRATINCOLE\\u2014 (G'/roro/a torqmla).

Mr. Yarrell (in whose first edition it appears at the iiead of the Rail-family) says \\u2014 \\\" The Pratincole has been arranged by some authors with the Swallows, by tthcin near the Rails ; but I believe, with ]\\u00bbIr. Selby, that it ought to be included in the family of the Plovers ; and had I kno\\\\\\\\Ti itr. Plover-liie habits and eggs sooner, I should have arranged it between Cursorius and Charadrius.\\\" To this Mr. Hewitson adds \\u2014 \\\" Besides the similarity of then- habits, the fact of this species laying four eggs is a further link to connect it with the Charadi-iidse.\\\" It is, liowever, much too rare \\u2014 besides being known not to breed in Britain \\u2014 to have any claim on our limited space for description of its nest or eggs. 163. GOLDEN ^LOTER\\u2014{Ckaradnus pluvialis). Yellow Plover, Green Plover, Wliistliug Plover. \\u2014 It has sometimes been an object to me to obtain specimens of this bird in its breeding-plumage, and it is scarcely possible to imagine a stronger contrast tlian that presented by the male in lils May di'ess and six or eight months later. All the glossy black of neck and breast has entirely disappeared long before the latter period. I have occasionally seen a single pair or two, very early in the year, separating themselves from the great flock of some scores ; and in the female of one such pair which I shot some few years since (the next shot killing five out of a very large flock at no great distance), I found an egg quite ready for extrusion, and which from the depth of its colourhig, would probably have been laid in the course of a few hours at most. The hen-bird makes a very slight nest, and lays just four eggs in it, seldom either more or less. They are of a large size for the bird, of a fair stone-colour, well blotched and spotted with very dark or blackish brown. After sitting eight or ten days the bird becomes very reluctant to leave her nest, and will suffer herself to be almost I 114 BRITISH BIRDS, THEIR EGGS AND NESTS. trodden on rather. The young ones, awkward-looking motlied yellow and brown puff-balls on stilts, run fast and well soon after they are batched, and do not speedily acquire the use of those \\u25a0wings which, after a time, are to be so strong and swift. Very jeaioas too, are the parents as long as their young are only runners, and very plaintive is their incessant piping if you or your dog approach too near their place of concealment. \\u2014 \\u00a5ig. 2, plate VII. 164. DOTT'E.ViEL\\u2014iCharadnus mormellus). Dottrel or Dotterel Plover, Foolish Dottrel. \\u2014 This is a summer visitor to our country, and in many localities where it used to be abundant, or at least common, it is now rare or almost unknown. This is the case on parts at least of the Yorkshire Wolds, as well as in the Lake district. They are sought after by the Fly-fisher and by the Ornithologist and by the Epicure, and from their exceedingly simple and unsuspicious habits they fall easy victims before the fowlhig-piece of modern days. The female makes no nest, but lays her customary three eggs in a slight cavity on the ground near high mountain tops, where some tall-growing moss or other mountain herbage facilitates concealment. The eggs are of an olivaceous hue, spotted plentifully with very dark brown or brownish-blacK. 165. RINGED PLOVER\\u2014 (C/^^ra^/rzz^s Uuticula). Ringed or Ring Dottrel. \\u2014 A very pretty shore-bird, of interesting habits, and not infrequent, especially in winter, on many parts of the British coast. In quiet parts, whore large expanses of sand or shingle, or even mud, are left by the receding tide, it may be seen in numbers. It seems to make no nest : \\u2014 the eggs are laid on the sand, and often at a very considerable distance from the sea ; as, for instance, on the warrens in Norfolk and Suffolk, They are four in number, very large in proportion to 115 the s:z3 of the bird, possessing the 2;cculiar pointcLl shape of tlie eggs of the entire class of birds we are now among, and of a warm cream-colour, spotted and streaked with black. The parent birds try hard to lead the casual intruder away from the vicinity of their young. \\u2014 Jig. 3, plate VII. IGG. KENTISH PLOVER\\u2014 (a^/r\\u00abf/r/\\u00ab.? Cmdianus). Seldom obtained vei-y far from the southern coasts of England, and not appearing to be a very plentiful bird e\\\\'en there. In liabits, it strongly resembles the Ring Plover just named. The female makes no nest, but lays her four eggs in a slight hollow on sand or shingle, which strongly resemble some of the lightercoloured examples of the eggs of the last-named species. \\u2014 Fig. 4, plate VII. 1G7.

A bird which has never been ascertained to breed in England, although specimens in the dark-breasted ]\\\\Iay plumage have been seen in the London Markets, and observed by Mr. Selby in the Fame Islands, in June. It is not uncommon as a winter visitor, lliough even then nothing like so numerous as the Golden Plover in its winter visits to districts in which it does not breed. The eggs are said to be in colour \\\" oil green, spotted with different shades of umber brown ; the spots, crowded and confluent round the obtuse end.\\\" 16D. LAP'vVING \\u2014 iVanellua cmtaius). ' I'ewit or Peewit, Te-wit, Teu-fit, Green Piover, Bastard Plover, Green Lapwing, Crested Lapwing. \\u2014 Anotiier of thosa bircib whiuh are familiar to almost everyone who is not a mere casual visitor to the country, or quite deaf and bUnd to its commonest sounds and sights. It is a very universally diflfused 116 BRITISH BIRDS, TIIEIK EGGS AND NBSTS. bird, even in those districts where it docs not statedly breed. It nests not only on commons and heaths and the wide moor, but in the fields and inclosures; and round my present residence 1 have many yearly evidences that there are half-a-dozen nests within tlie linuts of a sliort lialf-mile wliich intervenes between me and thfc moors. The female constructs scarcely any nest, properly so called, but makes or more likely avails herself of a ready-made slight cavity on the siu'face of the ground, with a sufficiency of some kind of herbage to serve as covert. The female's habits in tonnection with the nest and eggs are different from the male's. She slips off on the approach of a visitor, aud runs very silently and quietly away to some distance before taking wing ; he hastens up on rapid, sounding, whirling wing, and cries and dashes and wheels above and around the cause of alarm in a very remarkable manner. The Peewit lays four eggs, of large size and acutely pointed at the lesser end, and like so many others of the class, often arranged so as to occupy the least possible space, by having their pomts all turned inward. They are of a darkish olive-dun ground, abundantly blotched and spotted with brown and black. These eggs are much sought after as delicacies for the table. They are boiled hard and served cold, and when tlie shell is removed they have quite a jelly-like appearance. But very few of the eggs, however, sold in the market as \\\" Plovers'- eggs,\\\" are sometimes recognised by the oologist as having been laid by tlie Lapv/ing. \\u2014 Tig. 5, jilate VI L 170.

Pied Oyster-catcher, Shelder, Sea-Pie, Olive. \\u2014 A very beautiful and well-known dweller on our sea-coasts, and wonderfully provided by nature, too, with a suitable instrument for purveying its destined food. The bill of the Oyster-catcher is one of those natural objects which form each a study in themselves. Woe be to the oyster or mussel, however powerful its mechanism for closing its valves, if once the Oyster-catcher has found means to insert that natural weapon of his. Flattened sideways, and hard and strong as so much bone, its eiEcacy is so great that there can be scarcely a struggle for life on the part of the shell-fish. It runs well, and is even said to dive and swim with facility. I never saw this, though I have had them mider my observation for hours together in fonncr days. But I know their shrill, rattling whistle, and their short uneasy (lights, and restless paddlings up and doMTi upon the ooze, wlien I liave been among their haunts, well \\u2014 and marry a nest it used to be my lot to discover on some parts of some of the Essex Saltings. The eggs, usually three or four in number, are laid on the bare ground, sometimes in slight holes amid the Salting herbage above high-water mark ; or 118 BKITISU TilRDS, THEIR EGGS AND NESTS. where there is sliingle, in ?iome cavity among its 'higher and coarser layers.

Those birds were \\\" preserved\\\" with a strictness we scarcely can imagine even in these days of game-preserves. They were the peculiar game of royal and noble personages. Now, however, the case is widely different, and probably not one Heron in a himdred can now be met with as compared with the days of falconry. It is a strange odd sight to sec a Heron balancing himself on the topmost twig of some fir-tree, and succeeding after a few uneasy motions of body and wings in poising himself. The Heron sometimes breeds on precipitous rocks, but much more commonly on trees, \\u2014 generally trees of large size, and commonly oaks or firs. It is not a solitary builder, but Kke the Hook forms a community, and frequents the same tree or clump of trees tlircugh successive years for many generations. Each nest is of large size, and composed of sticks with a lining of wool. Four or five eggs are usually deposited, of an uniform pale green colour. A few nests ai-e said to hare been met with on the ground. \\u2014 Fiq. 1, ylate VIII. LITTLE BITTEKN. 175. PURPLE KERO'^\\u2014iJrdea purpurea).

A\\\\niaup. \\u2014 As common a bii'd as almost any along the whole of the British coasts. Sometimes smgly and sometimes in groups of eight or ten, it may be seen along the line of oozy shores or the sandy Qats which are laid bare by the receding tide. When the water is sufficiently high to cover all its feeding grounds, it betakes itself to some higher groiuid in the vicinity, to rest during those hours of inactivity in food-search. When removing from one place, or part of the coast, to another, it usually flics in long lines, which liowevcr scarcely maintain the same degree of accuracy as in the case of Wild Geese or other line-flying wild fowl. On the arrival of spring the Curlews leave the coast and retire to their breeding niunts iu the hills of the extreme north of England, the highest 15i2 BIUTISI! liiRL'S, TUEIK liGCiS AND NESTS. moorlands of Scotland, and other similar places in more norther!^ latitudes yet. Its note once heard is sufficiently noticeable to be easily recognised on any future occasion. It makes a very careless or rude nest, and lays four eggs which vary a good deal in the depth of the ground-colour and the amount of their spots. It is pale greenish dun, varying to olive-green, and spotted with darker shades of green and dark-brown. \\u2014 Fig. 3, jilate VIII. 190. ^\\\\lllls^>>\\\\l'EL\\u2014{Numenius phceopus). Wliimbrel-Curlew, Curlew-Jack, Curlew-Knot, Half-Curlew, Jack-Curlew, Stone Curlew, Tang-Whaap. \\u2014 No wonder it haa the name of Half-Curlew, for it does most strongly resemble a diminutive Curlew in its plumage, shape, fashion of bill, haunts, and many of its habits. It is seen, in no great numbers, on many of our coasts in winter ; nut I have met with it on the Essex Saltings only in the early spring and previous to its retirement to the north to breed. It is difficult to assert positively that it frequents any part of the main British Island for that purpose ; but it is known to nest in both Orkney and Shetland. The nest is said by Dr. Fleming to be placed in exposed parts of a moor. The eggs are four in number, and, though very much less in size very much like the darker varieties of the Curlew's eggs. The Whimbrcl is probably a fast decreasing species. 191. SPOTTED RED-SHANK\\u2014 (To^tf\\u00ab?\\u00ab/\\u00ab5r?\\u00ab').

Many ''>ng days have I spent amid their haunts on the Essex Saltings. Their nests are very slightly constructed of a few bits of grass amidst a tuft of herbage, or in a small hole or cavity which is sheltered by some cf the taller-growing marine plants. The eggs are usually :'our in number, occasionally but two or three, of a cream-colcur (sometimes daslicd with a somewhat warmer hue) spotted and speckled with dark brown. The spots are less and more numerous than in the case of the Peewit's egg. Tn the case of the last nest I foimd, about two years since, the old bird suffered me to walk within a yard of her before taking flight. \\\"WTien the young are newly hatched the parent birds betray excessive jealousy and anxiety at the approach of either man or dog to their resort. They liave sometimes come and settled on the ground within two or three paces of mc, and, at others, flown so directly towards me, as to suggest tlie possible intention of attacking mc, piping most plaintively and incessantly tlie wliile. This conduct is designated by the term \\\" mobbing,\\\" on the Essex marshes. Fi^. 4, plale VIII. ]93. GREEN ^\\\\lsT)-V\\\\Vn{.\\u2014{Tof anus och opus). It is supposed that a few of these birds may remain with us to breed ; but far the greater part of those which are customarily seen about the sides of our smaller streams and ditches and canals, are kno^vn to retui-n far to the north to produce their eggs and young. I believe no authenticated instances of its nesting with us are known, but a few very young birds have been met with under circumstances which seemed to leave no doubt that tliey must have been hatched in the neighbourhood.

It is not by any means a frequently occurring visitor, though it seems to be admitted that it is more than probable it sometimes breeds in this country. Mr. Hoy's account of its habits and nesting peculiarities, as observed by himself in Dutch Brabant, is quoted at length by both Mr. Yarrell and Mr. Ilewitson. He says, \\\" The nest is generally placed at a short distance from the water, among stunted heath, or scrubby plants of the Bog Myrtle, or among coarse grass and rushes. It is placed in. a hollow, and formed of dry grass and other plants. The eggs^ are four iia number.\\\" \\\" They are pointed in shape, of a pale greenish white, spotted and speckled, particularly over the broad end, with dark reddish brown,\\\" 195.

It is commO\\\".:ly seen running briskly along by the water edge of streams or lakes, or perhaps flitting along as disturbed by your sudden invasion of it\\u00bb haunt. Unlike the Dipper, wliich may constantly be seen sitting quite still near the edge of the stream, the Summer Snipe is always in motion. It makes a very rude nest of dry grass in some hole in a bank not far from water, where the shelter anil concealment of sufhcient herbage is available, and lays in it four eggs, which vary often in colour and spots but are usually of a ytUowish-white, with blotches and spots of deep brown or ordinary brown.

It is only rare as a species, and not known positively to breed anywhere much south of the Hebrides. The nest is said to be like that of the Golden Plover or Lapwing, consisting only of a few blades of grass or sprigs of ling, placed in a hollow in the soil. The eggs\\u2014 like so very many of those characterised by the pyriform shape peculiar to the Grallatores \\u2014 are placed with their pointed ends together in the middle, and are of a pale yellowish-green colour, spotted all over irregularly with dark brown with intermingled blotches of light pui-plish-grey ; the spots and blotches being more nuinerous at the larger end. 198.

But our forefathers tliought many things of the eatable sort good, which their descendants of ISGl had rather not sit down to. I rather tliink my young readers might not eat Poi-poise or Heron either, with any great relish, not to speak of other matter* about equally, or more questionably, \\\" good eating.\\\" Both this species of Godwit and the one to be mentioned next are subject, like the Golden Plover, the Gray Plover, the Spotted Redshank, aad many others yet to be named, to very great and striking changes of plumage in the breeding season. At all times they are handsome birds. Tiie Black-Tailed Godwit is believed stUl to breed, however rarely, in England \\u2014 in Norfolk and Cambridgeshire, in fact. The nest Is found in marshy places, made of dry grass and the like, and more or less concealed by the coarse i,'rowths peculiar to such places. The eggs vary in both size a:i.^. colours, but are usually of a greenish oiive-browTi, marbled and KUFF. 127 blotched with darker brown ; and, as usual in this class of birds, are generally four in iiuinber. 201.

Female, Reeve. \\u2014 Time was, and not so very long ago cither, when one fenman could take six dozen of these Ijirds in a suigle day. Now, I fear, be woidd scarcely get that number in an entire season. The Ruff is, however, stiU. known to breed annually in some of the fens of Lincolnshire and Cambridgeshire. The variety of plumage, no less than the very remarkable ruff or feathery appendage about the neck of the male in the breeding season, is quite sufficient to make this a very conspicuous bird among our truly native birds. Scarcely any two males in an assemblage of some dozens can, in some cases, be picked out as possessing exactly the same plumage. The breeding habits, or some of them, observed in this bird are also very characteristic. His Latin name, as given above, simply meats \\\"pugnacious warrior,\\\" and verily he is as thorough a lover of battle as any knight-errant of the middle ages, or fierce Northern sea-rover of four or five centuries earlier. They do not pair, and therefore fight for the possessioji of the females, and they have spots, known to the fenmen by the name of Hills, which are as much the scenes of universal challenge and battle as ever the stated \\\"lists\\\" of the old days of tournament or playing at battle. This habit of theirs faciUtates the process of capture vcrj 128 lUUTISII BIKDS, THEIR EGGS AND HESTS. materially, and by means of a peculiar kind of not, duly arranged before the day begins to dawn, the fowler is enabled to capture all, or almost all, who have been attracted by their peculiar instmcts to the vicinity of any given hill. The Reeves lay each her four eggs, which vary in colour from olive-green to a yellowish stone colour, and are spotted and blotched with \\\"liver colour\\\" and rich brown. 203. WOOD-COCK\\u2014 {Scolopax rudicola). One of our most universally recognised \\\"birds of passage,\\\" coming to us sometimes in the autumn (always, at least, beginning to arrive in October), and leaving us again in the spring ; still no season passes, there is reason to believe, in which many pairs do not remain to breed, and that too in many different parts of the kingdom. It was an object to me some twenty years ago to obtain eggs of the Woodcock, and I applied to a person in Norfolk, who had not any difficulty in procuring for me eggs from the gamekeeper of a neighboui'ing estate out o( two different nests which had been deserted by their owners. My friend added the information, that scarcely a year passed in which one nest or more of Woodcocks was not known of on the estate in question. The nest, a very loose one, is made of deaa leaves and the like. Bracken leaves appearing to be commonly used for the purpose. The eggs are usually about four in number, and want the peculiar pointed shape common to almost all the other birds of the Order. They are of a dirty yellowishwhite, a good deal blotched and spotted with two or three shades of pale brown and purplish-grey. The old bird is known to transport her young, if occasion demands, from one place to another. She has been seen doing so repeatedly, and by good observers, generally making use of both feet for the purpose, sometimes one only ; and, it is said, using her beak sometimes foi the same purpose. \\u2014 Fig. 1, plate IX. <;OM.MON SNll'E. 121 20i.

Solitary Snipe, Double Suipe. \\u2014 Often taken, no doubt, by many a sportsman in former days to be a very large specimen o the Common Snipe, than which no bird with wliieh I am well acquainted seems to vary more in si;5C. On the wing it does not look much larger than the Common Snipe, and is seldom seen except alone, or at most two in company. It breeds in higli northern localities, and never with us, and no notice, therefore, of its nesting habits is permissible in this place. 205. COMMON SmVE\\u2014iScolopax ffallimf/o). Whole Snipe, Snite, Heather-bleatcr. \\u2014 Although this Snipe, like the Woodcock, retires to northern latitudes to breed, yet there are few districts in Britain suitable to its habits in wliich it is not known to breed in greater or less numbers. And it is a bird, moreover, which is quite sure to make it very distinctly known that it has a nest and eggs somewhere near, if only any human visitor appears on the scene. I refer to the very peculiar note or sound emitted Ijy the male, always while he is on the wing high in the air, and always accompanied with a very remarkable action of his wings and curving descent iu his flight. This sound or note \\u2014 for it is not absolutely certain, I think, how it is produced \\u2014 is variously called humming, bleating, drumming, buzzing. To me, the first time I heard it, and before I knew to wnat origin to assign it, the impression produced was precisely that of a large Bee, entangled in some particular place and unable to extricate itself ; and I remem.ber spending some minutes in trying to discover the supposed insect. The eggs are usually four, placed in a very sh'ght and inartificial nest on the ground near some tuft of rushes or other water-herbage. They are of a greenish-olive hue, blotched and spotted with two or three shades of brown, the deepest being very dark. The old ones are said to K 139 BRITISH BIRDS, THEIR EGGS AND NKSTS. be very jealous and careful of their young.

CURLEW SAND-PIPER\\u2014 (r^/^a subarquata) This little bird, which serves to connect the true Snipes with the sea-frequenting Snipes, or Sandpipers, was till lately considered to be a very rare and occasional visitor. But it is very likely to have been confused with the Dunlin, or other small shore-birds, and is now supposed even to breed occasionally in our country.

The male has a conspicuous weddingdress, which he duly puts on in the Spring, and once it was on R 2 132 BlllTISII BIKDS, THEIR EGGS AND KESTS. he was ciiristened Tringa Alpina, tlie DuiJin. Then in the autiunn and winter, having divested himself alike of his summer dress and alJ properly or concern in wife and children, he wa? named anew Tringa Cinclus, the Purre. On its behig satisfactorily ascertained that the only real difference between Dunlin and Purre was that of a few feathers, and those cliiefly on the breast, and dependent simply on Season, the new name at the head of this notice was suggested and willingly adopted as altogettier a fit one. The Dunlin, always called Oxbird where my boyhood was spent, and often seen there in flocks of not simply hundi'cds, but thousands, and many thousands, in the autumn and winter, goes to the far north to breed, though some of their hosts stay in the north of Scotland, the Hebrides, Orkneys and other Islands near. Their nests are placed on the ground, among long grass and ling, and always contain four eggs. Mr. Hewitson says : \\u2014 \\\" In beauty of colouring and elegance of form the eggs of the Dunlin are unrivalled. The groundcolour is sometimes of a clear light green, richly spotted with, light brown ; sometimes the ground-colour is of a bluish-white.\\\"' The hen will suffer herseK to be removed from her nest by the naud rather than leave her eggs. \\u2014 Ylg. 3, plate IX. 217.

In most of the northern parts it breeds annually, but I clo not remember ever hearmg its breeding note while I was a dweller in the district embracing what are usually called the Eastern Counties. Nor yet in Herefordshire. But the note in question has been sufficiently familiar to me for the last twenty years, and here in North Yorkshire I hear it on all sides of me, at all hours, I may say, of day and night. For two or three years in succession a pair took possession of a small plantation of young fir trees bordering my garden lawn on the north, and only separated from it by a deep ditch with a run of water at the bottom. Long after the union seemed to have been formed the pecidiar note was kept up, and I used to see both birds within a few feet of each other during its continuance. Scarcely a day passed during their sojourn of eight or ten days in and about the plantation, but excursions were taken into the garden, frequently extending to the terrace beneath my dining-room window, where sundry very inquirnig and mterested glances \\u2014 not to say stares \\u2014 were exchanged between the visitors and myself and divers members of my family. The visitors seemed very little disturbed at our notice as long as we remained quite still and silent, but any movement on our part led to immediate retreat on the Corn Crake's. Its movements were desultory or in jerks, so to Bpeak. The bird would run ten or twelve paces in an attitude and with a speed which left one in doubt for a moment whether it were not some small quadruped. Tiien it would 134 BRITISH BIRDS, TUEIR EGGS AND >'ESTS, skulk amid taller herbage, or under tlie slirubs of a raised bed, m beneath a rhododendron bush. A minute after it would be seea with its head and whole body erect, and the neck so out-stretched that if the bird had been hung up by its head it could not have been much more elongated. This was the invariable position or attitude assumed when interchanging looks with tlie occupants of the window. My own impression was that these journeys or excui-sions (which I knew extended into the grass-Held beyond the garden, and into a field over the road at the back of tlie plantation) were simply made for the purpose of inspection, and with a view to the selection of a place for nesting \\u2014 and tliat, pending this interesting investigation, the fir trees and herbage baucatli afforded an ample covert. As far as I could ascertain, the place actually selected by them for the purpose was in the field \\u2014 a corn-field \\u2014 just beyond that which lay adjacent to the garden. The Corn Crake makes a loose nest of dry herbage and stalks and grass ; and I think almost always among growing herbage \\u2014 grass, clover, or corn. The hen lays seven or eight eggs, sometimes even ten, and sits very close upon them. They are whitish in ground, suffused with a reddish tinge, and spotted and speckled with brownish-red and purplish-grey . \\u2014 Fig. 4, phi{e IX. 219. SrOTTED CRk'K'E\\u2014{Crex j^orzana). A summer visitor, as the Land Rail is, to our shores. It is rare, however, compared with the Land Rail, and with more predilection for the vicinity of water. Like all tlie other Rails it conceals itself very closely, and from the form of its body and power of leg runs with great speed and equal facility, even among what seems to be and is very thick covert. It is knowai to breed m Norfolk and in Cambridgeshire, and is believed to do 40 in other localities as well. The nest, made on the ground i\\u00bb WATEK-RAIL. 105 wet marshes, is \\\"formed on the outside,\\\" says Mr. Yarrell, \\\" with coarse aquatic plants, lined witii finer materials within.\\\" From seven to ten eggs appears to be the number laid, and they vary very much in their ground-colour, between a pale brownishdun and a slightly yellow-white, the spots or blotches being of a reddish brown of some intensity. \\u2014 Fig. 5, plate IX. 220. LITTLE Q,RKKE\\u2014{Crex pusilla). Olivaceous Gallinule, Little Gallinule. \\u2014 Strictly speaking, still a rare bird in this country. 221. BAILLON'S CRAKE\\u2014 (<7/-^.r BaiUonii). More rare than the last, and, perhaps, occasionally confused with it. 222. WATER V.kTL\\u2014{Ralliis aquaticus). Bilcock, Skiddycock, Runner, Brook-runner, Velvet-runner. \\u2014 One of the very shiest of our British birds, and thus seeming to be much more rare tlian it really is. I have seen it at a 1 seasons of the year, though it is, I am weU aware, less tolerant of cold than many other of our winter-stay mg birds. Its motions on the bank of a stream, when suddenly disturbed, are much more like those of a Water Rat than a bird. It breeds with some degree of commonness in several of the Southern counties. I obtained two nests from the estate in Norfolk, already mentioned in these pages, at the same time with the Woodcock's eggs, and was informed that it bred regularly there. I had reason also to know that it bred at ToUeshunt D'Arcv, in Essex. The nest is made often in an osier ground or among thick water plants, and composed of different kinds of aquatic herbage. The eggs are from six to nine or ten in number, and seldom quite white mhue; usually they are much more like pale or faded specimens of the Land Rail's eggs, the spots being both fewer and fainter. \\u2014 Fig. ht plate IX, J36 BITISU BUIDS, THElll EGGS A.NH KtSlS. 223. MOOR ilES\\u2014{Gallinula cJiloropus). Water Hen, Gallinule, Moat Hen, Marsh Hen.\\u2014 Few nesthiuaters, liowcver young, hut know the nest and eggs of this very common bird. I have in many cases seen it almost domesticated, and constantly taking its food among domestic fowls, and sometimes even almost from the hands of human creatm-es. Its nest is made in somewhat various places. I have seen it amid the sedges growing in the water near the edge of a marsh-ditch or the like, on di-y tussocky tumps near a sheet of water, among ^he herbage and wiUow stubs not far from the same Mere, built upon masses of fallen but not decayed buh-ushes and flags, at the edge of a pond, on a bough projecting several feet horizontally from the bank over and resting upon (or partly in) the water of a running stream, nay, even in a branch or top of a thick tree, or among the ivy which mantled its trunk and wreathed its branches. In it are laid six, seven, or eight eggs, of a reddish-white colour, sparingly speckled and spotted with reddish-brown. The eggs have been known to be removed by the parent birds under circumstances of perd awaiting them \\u2014 from a flood for instance \\u2014 and hatched in some new locality. Instances also have been recorded in which a supplementary nest has been constructed by the female parent to receive a part of her brood, when they were too numeious mid had grown too large to be accommodated by their original nest-home at night. \\u2014 Fiff. 7, plate IX. VI.\\u2014 LOBIPEDIDvE. 224.\\u2014 COOT\\u2014 (i^\\u00ab//f\\u00ab atra). Bald Coot.\\u2014 A common bird enough in many parts of tne kingdom, and, in former days, I have sometunes seen them in straggling flocks of several hundreds or tliousands along the tide- way GKEr-LKGGED GOOSE, 1^7 on the Essex coasts. Witli its white oval spot ou the forehead, and perfectly black plumage, it is a suillcieatly noticeable bird. It seems to be much more at home on the water than on land ; but, like the Moor lien, can and does move with very considerable ease and speed on the latter. The Coot makes a large and very strong and compact nest, makmg or finding a Gxm foundation for it below the surface of tlie water, and heaping up and twisting in dry flags and bukushes and pieces of reed, until some of the nests are sufEcicntly firm and stable to support a considerable weight. The eggs laid are usually seven or eight, and up to ten; though even twelve or fourteen have been mentioned as sometimes found. They are of a dingy stone-colour, speckled and spotted with dark brown. \\u2014 Fi^. 8, p/aie IX. 225. GREY PHALAROPE\\u2014 (P//\\u00ab/\\u00abro;??\\u00ab loba(us). Red Phalarope. \\u2014 Supposed, some half-century since, to be exceedingly rare in this country, but now known to visit our shores in small numbers, perliaps annually, on their way to their winter place of sojourning. Like the Coot, they arc lobe-footed, and very capable swimmers. 226. RED-NECKED niMjrVllO^'E.\\u2014iF/iaiaropus hijpsrhoreus). Red Piialarope. \\u2014 More rare than the last-named in England, though occun-ing, occasionally, somewhat more abundantly in some of tlie northern Scotch Islands. v.\\u2014 NATATORES. FAMILY I.\\u2014 ANATIDtS. 227. GREY-LEGGED GOOSE\\u2014 (J;^?er/er\\u00abj). Grey-lag Goose, Grey Goose, Wild Goose. \\u2014 It is not proposed to give any illustrations whatever of the eggs of the Wildfowl \\u2014 the Geese, Swans, Ducks, ar.d Divmg Ducks \\u2014 inasmuch as they are not only of large size, and would usurp much space 138 BHITISU BIRDS, THEIR EGGS AND NESTS. to the absolute exclusion of many others of much interest and urgently demanding pictorial illustration, but, also, are characterised by so much sameness or general uniformity of colour ; \\u2014 for they vary only, in that respect, about as much as the eggs of the common Fowl and common Duck do. A very large proportion of them, moreover, never by any chance breed in any portion of the British Islands, but resort to distant and very northerly localities for that purpose. The first on our list, the Common Grey, or Wild Goose, is an instance in point. It is believed once to have been a regular inhabitant, and to have bred abundantly in the fenny districts which then prevailed over many parts of the kingdom, not at all near or connected with what is yet called \\\" the fen country.\\\" But now it is comparatively a rare bird at any season of the year, and nests no nearer to us than some of the isles and coasts of Scandinavia. 228. BEAN GOOS^\\u2014(Jnser set/e^/m). Like the last, and in common witli the Geese next to be men* tioned, indiscriminately know^l by the name of Wild Goose. Unlike the last, however, it is ascertained to breed in small numbers on some of the large lakes in the north of Scotland, and iu the islands of Ijf^wis and Harris. Besides which, a nesting locality of this species in Westmoreland is named. The nests, iu some instances, are hid in very tall ling, and the eggs are from five to seven in number. In size they are a little under 3| inches long by 2^ broad. 229. PINK-rOOTED GOOSI.\\u2014(Jnser hrachyrhyncus). A smaller bird than the last, but otherwise bearing a veiy strolls' resemblance to it ; so much so, that it appears more than probable it has often been assumed to be a young or small specimen of the former species. It is, however, of compai'atively raro occurrence notwithstanding. BRENT GOOSE. 1S9 230. WHITE-FRONTED GOOSE\\u2014 (^\\u00ab.?ca alblfrons). Laughing Goose. \\u2014 A regular winter visitor, and not in any very scanty numbers. One of my very worst discomfitures in my early sporting-days took place in connection with a flock of these birds. There were seven or eight of them -which flew deUberately right on towards my fatlier and myself till they were within twentyfive yards of us, and then they doubled up into a confused clump, and I was already counting the slain when my gun missed fire. My father's did not, and gave us the opportunity of identifying the species. It breeds in Scotland and other countries far to the north. 231. BERNICLE GOOSE\\u2014 (^;wer leucopsis). Another winter visitor ; often appearing in great flocks, but always retiring to the north again to breed. It is supposed to frequent the shores of the White Sea especially for such purpose. 232. BRENT GOOSE\\u2014 (4;^.ye/- brcutu). Black Goose, Ware Goose. \\u2014 By far tlie most numerous of all the geese which visit oiir shores in winter, as it is also the least. I have seen it in inconceivable numbers on the Essex coast in hard winters, and the numbers reported to have been killed at one discharge of a heavy ]mnt-gun, seem simply incredible. In the very hard and loug-coutiuued winter of 1S37-3S, I saw the ice which, in broken fragments of four or five feet square by three or four inches thick, covered the whole estuary of the Blackwater at ToUesbury (a space ot very considerable width), black with them during highwater. The expression m.ade use of by one of the sea-faring men of the neighbourhood was, \\\"There are acres of 'em.\\\" StiU of all their vast numbers none remain to breed, and no great proportion of them are known to breed in Europe. 140 BRITISH BIRDS, TUEIR EGGS AND NESTS. 233. KED-BREASTED GOOSE\\u2014 (Jnser rujicollis). A very rare species, and one of which but little is known as to history or habits. 234.. EGYPTIAN GOOSE\\u2014 (^\\u00ab*.-- Egi/piiacus). Equally rare and more exceptional than the last : as the few that have occurred may have escaped from confinement. 235. SPUR-WINGED GOOSE\\u2014 (^\\u00ab5er Gambensis). Gambo Goose. \\u2014 An accidental visitor mdeed. 23G. CANADA GOOSE\\u2014 {Anser Ca)iadeiisis). Cravat Goose. \\u2014 Many of these remarkably fine birds are kept on ornamental waters in many different parts of the kingdom ; and these have been known sometimes (aided by a storm, perhaps. or some unusual occurrence) to make their escape. Many of the supposed wild birds shot, or otherwise taken, have been accounted for on the supposition that they are such escaped birds. However, it would seem most probable that considerable flights of really wild Cravat Geese do occasionally visit this country, and even that some pair or two of them may occasionally stay to breed. The eggs are six. to nine in number, of very large size and white. 237. llOOVEl\\\\\\u2014{C!/ffm(s feria). Wild Swan, Whistling Swan, Elk. \\u2014 Of sufficiently common occurrence on the British coasts, and particularly in hard winters. Few birds vary much more in size and weight than do these. A young bird of the year may weigh only twelve or thirteen pounds ; the older and more full-grown specimens, twenty or twenty-one. They breed very far to the north. 238. BEWICK'S S\\\\Nm\\u2014{Ci/gnus Bewickii). A smaller bird than the Hooper, and of very much rarer occurrence. Still it is an ascertained species, and visits us frequently, not annually, in some numbers. COilMON SUIELDRAKR. 141 239. MUTE SWAIi\\u2014iCyffms oior.) The Common tame Swan of our ornamental waters. \\u2014 They Are found wild in many, if not all, the nortlicrn countries of Europe. It is too well knov\\\\Ti by everyone to require detailed notice here, 240. POLISH SWAN\\u2014 ((%\\u00ab\\u00ab5 immutabilis). A bird of very rare occurrence in a wUd state, and deriving its Latin name from the circumstance that its plumage undergoes no change in colour at any period of its age. It is always wliite. The cygnets of the other swans are, on the contrary, grey or dusky-coloured for a lengthened period, and only become wliite on their reaching maturity. 241. RUDDY SHrELDRAKE\\u2014 (^fl^oraa rutila). A bird of exceedingly rare occurrence. 242. COMMON SHIELDRAKE\\u2014 (r\\u00ab^ora\\u00ab vulpamer). Burrow Duck, Skel Goose, Bar Goose. \\u2014 One of the very most beautiful of aU our wild fowl, or even of those which for their beauty are selected to be ornamental accessions to the waters of the park or pleasm-e-ground. Its plumage is so beautiful and clear and brilliant, and its attitude in repose so graceful, one camiot but admire it greatly. It breeds not uncommonly on many sandy parts of our coasts, occupying the deep rabbit-burrows, which are found in what are called the \\\" sand-hills,\\\" to place its nest in. Tiie nest is one reaUy, made of bents and dry stalks, and lined or cushioned with down liberally plucked from the builder's own breast. The number of eggs laid varies between eight or nine and twelve or fourteen. They are nearly or quite white, about 2f inches long by nearly 2 in breadth. I have known instances in which the eggs obtained from one of tlicir nests have been hatched under a common Hen. The young seemed to accustom themselves to their life of restraint tolerably 143 liUlTISII BllltS, rUEIR ECGS AND NESTS. well, out never showed any disposition to pair or breed. Fro. bably it might be because no suitable hole for a nest was withm their reach. The male of this species is known to assist the female in the labours and constraint of incubation. 243. SHOVELLER\\u2014 (^\\u00abas clypeatd). Elue-wiiiged Shoveller, Broad bill. \\u2014 The first ia the list of the true Ducks, and a very beautifully plumaged bird indeed. But gaily feathered as he is, and brilliant as is a part, at least, of the plumage of all the male Ducks during a certain portion of the year, yet it is remarkable that they all undergo a change in this respect about the breeding time, just the reverse of that which takes place in the males of so many other birds at the same season. They become more brilliant, or their colours deeper or richer then: \\u2014 the male ducks duskier, plainer coloui-ed, more like the female in her more unobtrusive hues. The Shoveller's biU is very remarkable, and, as I said of the Oyster-catcher's, a study for all who admu-e the works of God. It merits our notice for its adaptation to its purposes in a direction just opposite to that which characterizes the bill of the bird just named. Dilated at the sides so as almost to look awkward, it is furnished with a large series of very sensitive laminae or plates, such that the minute objects which form a considerable portion of the bird's food may be instantly detected by the sense of touch, and retamed. It used to breed very commonly in many parts of the kingdom, Norfolk and tlie Een districts for instance, as well as in. Homney Marsh and other places more in the south of the Island. At present it has become comparatively rare. The nest is made ol fine grass, and the eggs are eventually enveloped in down procured from the bird's o\\\\vn breast. The eggs may be from eight to twelve in number, white, tinged with a greenish-dun shade, and about 2 inches long by \\\\\\\\ broad. WILD r^LTK. 1*3 244. GADWALL\\u2014 (.//i\\u00ab5 sCreperu). Hodge, Grey Duck. \\u2014 A Duck which occurs L\\\\ no very great Ctimbers at any time ; mostly about the end of the -whiter, or in spring; and is not known to breed commonly in any part of ilorope. 2i5. PINTAIL BVGK\\u2014iAnas acuta) Cracker, \\\"Winter Duck. \\u2014 An early visitor to our sliores wliea winter has once urged the wild fowl hosts to leave their nortliern nesting-places. It is not, however, a numerous bird with us, but abounds in many of the northernmost countries of Europe. 246. BIMACULATED Ti\\\\]CYi\\u2014{AnasgIocitans). Hather a handsome bird in plumage and markings, but one of rare occurrence, and of which or its liabits very little is known. 247. WILD DUCK\\u2014 (^ms boschas). MaUard. \\u2014 By far the most common of all our wild fowl among the Ducks, but lessening, year by year, in the numbers which visit us. Within my own recollection many Decoys on the Essex coast were wrought constantly and successfully, which for many years now have been dismantled and unused. I well remember, when I was a lad of ten or twelve, being at a house in Tolleshunt D'Arcy, on the farm belonging to which was an active Decoy, and seeing the birds whicli had been taken in the course of one morning. Tlie numbers were so great tluit many of the undermost Ducks, where the great accumulation had taken place at the end of the \\\" pipe,\\\" bad died of pressure and suffocation, and some even were sensibly flattened by the superincumbent weight of their fellows. The multiplication of shooters on shore and afloat has sensibly tended to lessen the numbers of the Wild Duck ; while di-ainage on a large scale in many a district the country through, has materially lessened the number of their haunts. Still a very considerable number remain to breed, and 144 BlUTISU BIRDS, TllEIK EGGS AND NKSTB. a Wild Duck's nest in many parts of the kingdom is no raritj. The nest is made of grass, lined and interwoven -with down. It is customarily placed on dry ground on the margin of water, among reeds and bulrushes, or the like ; but may often be found at sorae distance from water, and in places so unlikely for the purpose as on tlie open moor, or in a tree top, or in tlie lofty deserted nest of a crow. The eggs are from nine to twelve in number, sometimes however exceeding the latter limit, of a ;\\u00bbreeuish-white colour, and about 2 j inches long by 1 1 broad. It is long before the young Wild Ducks fly well enough to leave their native reed beds, or similar shelter, and, in the state preceding that of actual power to fly away, they are called Flappers; and many a Flapper hunt have I taken part in in my youngei days. 248. GARGANEY\\u2014 (y/\\u00ab\\u00abi querquedidd). Summer Duck, Summer Teal, Pied Wiggon. \\u2014 This is a somewhat rare bird, and is seen sometimes in late autumn, but more usually in the spring. It has been known to breed in this country, though by no means commonly or frequently. It is said to make a nest among reeds of dry grass, rushes and down, and the number of eggs deposited to run from eight or nine tc twelve, or even more. They are of a disiiuct but pale bufT colour. If inch long by l^- broad. 249. TEAL \\u2014 {Anas crecca). A very pretty little Duck, and the least of all our wLite? visiters of that species. It is of common occurrence, but not met with in any great numbers. It breeds abundantly in Norway and Sweden, and especially in Lapland, whither the great oulk of our winter friends retire on the approach of the northern summer ; stiU, pairs often remain throughout the summer in various parts of oui- country to nest and rear their young. EIDER DUCK, 14? WTieu 1 was a boy 1 heard of nests, almost annually, on seme of the marshes 1 knew most familiarly. Tlie Teal builds a nest ot\\\" abundance of different vegetable substances, varying according to the locality and its productions, and luies it with down and feathers, the concealment afforded by the neiglibouring herb^e being carefully adopted. Eight to ten or twelve eggs are laid, of a buffy-white, If inch long by rather over 1^ broad. 250. WIGEON\\u2014 (^\\u00ab\\u00ab5 Penelope). Wliewer, V^Hum. \\u2014 Mr. Watertou has recorded an observation on the habits of this Duck, which is of great interest. Whereas, all the birds of the Duck-kind which we have hitherto named arp night-feeders, the Wigeon obtains its food by day, \\\" and that food is grass.\\\" The great body of our winter visitors of this species retire to the north to breed about the end of March, or April ; but a few have been ascertained to remain for that purpose in north Scotland. A nest, found on Loch Laighal in Sutherlandshire, was \\\" placed in the midst of a clump of grass, and was made of decayed rushes and reeds, with a lining of its own dowTi. The eggs were smaller than tliose of the Wild Duck, and of a rich cream-white colour.\\\" The number of eggs laid varies between five and eight or nine; the length, 2\\\\ inches by 1| in breadth. 251. AMERICAN TV^GEON\\u2014 (^\\u00aba5 Americana^ Of entirely rare and accidental occurrence. 252. EIDER ^^^^^\\u2014{Somatena mollissima), St. Cuthbert's Duck. \\u2014 We have now arrived at another section of the Duck family. Those hitherto named all frequent the fresh waters, and chiefly affect those that are of no great extent or depth. These, the first of which we have just named, frequent the sea or, in a few instances, the deepest parts of large freshwater lakes. The Eider Duck, well-known to most of us by t 146 BRITISH BIRDS, THEIR EGGS AND NESIS. name, to some of us by sight, breeds in some marshes on tb\\u00bb? Faroe islands, and in many of the islands on the coast of Scotland. The nests are principally composed, on a foundation of sea-weed cr grass, of the beautiful light elastic down, commonly known aa Eider-down ; and if the first is plundered, a second, and even \\u00bb third are formed ; but the down decreases in quality and quantity in each successive instance. The first accumulation is so large and springy as quite to conceal the eggs contained, which are usually five in number, and are of a light-green colour, about three inches long by two wide. The lining of one nest, admitting of easy compression by the hand, is described oy Mr. Hewitson as capable, when fully expanded, of filling a man's hat. 253. KING DJJCK\\u2014iSomaieria spectabilis). A much rarer bird than the last ; indeed occurring only very casually. It has been known to breed in one of the Orkney Islands, wliile Iceland, Nova Zcmbla, Spitzergen, and like localities, are the great breeding haunts of the species. The nests are made on the ground, and contain five eggs, very closely resembling the Eider-duck's, except in size. They are rather less. 254. STELLER'S WESTERN DUCK\\u2014 (Po.>5/eV/rt Stelleri). Exceedingly rare in Britain, and not much less so, it seems, in. Eui'ope generally. 255. \\\\T:LVET ^COTm.\\u2014{Oidemiafusca). Velvet Duck. \\u2014 A winter visitor, and rare on our south coasts. More common in the far north of Britain. 256. COMMON SCOTER.\\u2014 {Oidemia nigra). Scoter, Black Scoter, Black Duck, Black Diver. \\u2014 This duskycoloured Duck is seen in considerable numbers on various parts of our coasts in winter, and always swimming and diving in what may be called \\\" loose order,\\\" like the Coots rather than any TUFTED DUCK. 147 of the true Ducks. It does not, however, ever stay to breed with us, and can have no further notice nere. 257. SURF ^C01^K\\u2014{0idemia perspicillata). A bird of very rare, and, perhaps also it may be added, very local occurrence. 258. IIED-CRESTED WHISTLING Ji\\\\]CYi\\u2014{Fuligula rufina). Again another occasional vistor. 259. YOQjVLKSSi\\u2014iFuUgulafenna). Dunbird, lled-hcaded Wigeon, lied-headed Poker, Duncur. \\u2014 A whiter visitor, and in very considerable numbers in districts where the presence of inland waters to a s'xfBcient extent enables them to follow out then- natural habits. It is ahnost impossible, from their great quickness and skill in diving, to take them with tlie other \\\" Fowl \\\" in the Decoy, and they are therefore captured by a peculiar arrangement of nets affixed to poles so heavily weighted at one end as on being Liberated to elevate the net in such a way as to intercept the flight of the birds, as soon as they are fairly on wing. The Dimbu'd does not now breed in this country. 260. FERRUGINOUS DUCK\\u2014 (i^\\u00ab%\\u00ab/a nyroca). Somewhat resembling the Pochard in general hue, but smaller, and in respect of the numbers in which it has been met with in this country, comparatively a very rare visitor. 261. SCAUP DUCK\\u2014 (i^\\u00ab%/^/\\u00ab marila). Spoon-bill Duck. \\u2014 A winter visitor, and not an unusual one, although its numbers are never such as to commend it to notice in the same way as the Wild Duck, the Dunbird, the Wigeon, and some others. It breeds commonly in Iceland, but never in Britain. 262. TUFTED DUCK\\u2014 (i^\\u00ab%a& cristata). Another constant winter visitor, and as well or better known than the Scaup. Like the Scaup Duck it usually prefers oozy or muddy estuaries and their customary accompaniments. But L 2 148 BRITISH BIRDS, THJCIR EGGS AlUJJ StarB. have met willi it here in the narrow, rapid trout-stream which 1 uiis through this part of the country, and at a distance of not less than nine or ten miles from the sea. It breeds sparingly iu Holland and in more northerly countries. 2G3. LONG-TAILED T>VCY^\\u2014{Fulignla glasialii). Another bird wliicli, like the two last, is sufficiently wellknown witnout Demg exceedingly or indeed in the least degree numerous. It is in fact a rather rare and very beautiful Duck, and is remarkable for the great variations of plumage to which it 13 liable, according to differences of age, sex, and season. It breeds abundantly in Norway and Denmark, and much more so in puj-ely Arctic regions. 204. HAllLEQUIN DUCK\\u2014 (2^\\u00ab%a/\\u00ab histrionica). Another very beautiful bird, and most peculiarly marked. So much so as to remind its sponsors, as it appears, of the artistic effects produced by tlie customary pictorial adoriunent of our facetious friend Harlequin's face. A rarer bird, however, than even the Long-tailed Duck last named. 2C5. GOLDEN YXE\\u2014iFuligula clangula). Brown-headed Duck, Grey-lieaded Duck, Pied Wigeon, Goldeneyed Wigeon, Duck or Teal, Morillon, Rattlewings. \\u2014 As well known and as common as perhaps either the Scaup or the Tufted Duck, but known by different names according to the \\u2022tate of plumage depending on sex and age, females and young oirds being much more common than adult males. As not known to breed in England no notice of nest or eggs can be inserted here. In the Appendix, 'lowever, a very interesting notice of one of its habits connected with its breeding time will be inserted. 2GG. BUEEEL-HEADED DUCK\\u2014 (2^^%k/\\u00ab albeola).

Tiie Smew is perhaps quite the most common of tlie entire family; but they are very wary and difficult to api)roach. They are not known to breed m any part of the United Kingdom. 26S.

Red-breasted Goosander. \\u2014 This handsome bird is an undoubted denizen of our country during the breeding season, but in nr> great numbers in any year or district. It breeds in Ireland, on islands in several of the Loughs ; also in the Hebrides and otjier Scottish islands. The nest is made of long grass or moss, small roots, di-y water-herbage, mixed and lined with the bird's own down, doubtless added to as incubation proceeds. It is often placed at the foot of a tree, if there be one on the islet selected. The eggs are six to nine in number, of a pale buff or fawncolour. They are 2| inches long by If broad. 270. GOOSANDER.\\u2014 (J/er^\\u00ab5 merganser). Dun Diver, Sparling Fowl, Jacksaw, Saw-biU. \\u2014 A few of these birds also remain to breed in Britain, though by far the most retire to the north of Europe for that purpose. Its nests are common in both the Orkney Islands and the Hebrides. They are large, made of dry grass and roots, and lined with the down of ^le female, and placed amid bushes or stones, or in some cavity afforded by an old tree. The eggs rarely exceed six or seven, 150 BKITISII BIKDS, THEIR EGGS AND NESTS. not varying much in shade from those last descnbed, and are 2| inches in length, by nearly ] | in breadth. II.\\u2014 COLTMBIDtE. 271. GREAT CRESTED GR'EBK\\u2014{Podiceps crisiains}. Cargoose, Loon, Greater Loon, Tippet Grebe. \\u2014 We have come now to the Divers properly so called, and the family of Grebes to be noticed first are to be looked upon as principally out not exclusively, frequenting the fresh water. The bii-d now under notice remains almost all the year on the large sheets of water which it inhabits in Wales, Shropshire, Norfolk, and Lincolnshire. Like the rest of the Grebes, it is little able to walk and not much disposed to fly, but possessing marvellous capacity and power of diving. Its nest is made of a large heap of half rotten waterweeds, but little raised above the surface of the water, and always soaked with wet. On this likely-seeming place for duly addling every egg deposited, three, four or five eggs are laid, which are almost white when newly di'opped, but soon become so stained from constant contact with wet and decaying vegetable substances as to be any colour rather than white. They are about 2i inches long, by 1^ broad. The eggs, in the absence of the parent bu'd, are usually found covered with portions of some water vegetable ; and the owner, on being disturbed on her nest, always dives away from it. The first lessons of the young Loon in diving are taken beneath the literal \\\" shelter of their mother's wing.\\\" 272. RED-CRESTED GR'EBR\\u2014iPodiceps rubnccUis), Not so common as the Grebe last named, and more frequently met with on salt water, though not usually far from some estuary or inland arm of the sea. It is cot known to iiave bred in thia country. LlTlLli GREBE. ]51 273. SCLAVONIAN GR'EB'E\\u2014iPodicejJs cornutm). Dusky Grebe, Horned Grebe. \\u2014 Rather a rare bird in tlie summer, and not common at any period of tiie year; nor has it ever been known to breed with us. 274. EARED GREBE\\u2014 (Po(//c^s awnto). The rarest of all the Grebes. It occurs however from time to time, and I knew of one instance in Esses some thirty years ago in which one of these birds was taken from a \\\"Water-Rat's hole into which it had been seen to creep for shelter. 275. LITTLE GREBE\\u2014 (Por//c^^5 minor). Dabchick or Dobchick, Didapper, Small Ducker, Blackchiu Grebe. \\u2014 A very common and very interesting little bird, and yet, in spite of its frequency and familiarity, blessed with a couple of scientific names, originating (as in the case of the Dunlin), in differences of plumage, depending on age or season. It is difficiJt to say where it is 7wt to be met with in spring, provided only there be what the Americans call a sufficient \\\" waterprivilege,\\\" neither too shallow nor too rapid, for its requirements. As expert a diver as any of those hitherto named, it seldom resorts to the use of its wings, except just at the time when bu'ds' lovemakuig goes on. Then the male (at least) may be seen working his short wings most vigorously and rapidly, uttering his rattling cry as he circles over and about the Mere on which he has \\\" squatted \\\" for the season. The nest is a lieap of water weeds only just flush with the surface, and always steeping wet. The eggs are four, five or six in number, perfectly white when laid, but soon ceasing to be clean-looking, for they grow more dingy day by day, until on some waters they become completely mudcoloured, on others, assume a hue which I can compare to nothing but old blood stains on some du-ty surface. I am quite convinced that in some cases at least this discolouration is intentional on the 152 BRlTlSn BIRDS, THEIR EGGS AND KEtTS. part of the parent bird, though in others it may be simpl^f due tc the action of the juices of fresh or decaying vegetable substances I never yet, though I have seen some dozens of nests, found the eggs left uncovered by the owner, save only in one instance, in which only one egg had been laid. The weeds used as a covering were, moreover, in the majority of instances, fresh, and evidently procured by the Dabchick in virtue of her skill in diving. The young birds swim and dive almost immediately they are hatched, and are very persevering little skulkers if disturbed on their breeding waters. 276. GREAT NORTHERN BlVI.n\\u2014iColt/mdus fflacialis). Greatest Speckled Diver, Great Doucker,Immer,Immer Diver. \\u2014 This magnificent bird \\u2014 I shot one, in full plumage, several years since, which weighed nearly thirteen pounds \\u2014 is usually found at some distance from the coast, except during that part of the year which is devoted to the work of propagation. There seems good reason to think some of them may breed in some of the most northerly British Islands, but no authentic history of its ever naving been known to do so, is, I believe, extant. 277. BLACK-TIIROATED DIVLR\\u2014 (Co/ymi\\u00abs ardicus). Lumme, Norlliern Doucker, Speckled Loon. \\u2014 The rarest of the three Divers known in our seas. It is, however, described as breeding in several ol the lakes of Sutherlandshire. It makes no nest, but lays its two eggs on the bare ground, at no great distance from the water-edgo. These aie in some instances of a light shade of chocolate-brown, others having more of an olive-brown tinge about them, and sparingly spotted with black. 278. RED-THROATED J)lTE.R\\u2014{Coli/mbus sepleniriomli.\\\"). Rain Goose, Cobble, Sprat-borer, Spratoon, Speckled Divct COMMON GUILLEMOT. 153 \\u2014 The commonest and the smallest of the Divers, and vailing greatly in their plumage, according to age and season. It breeds on the Scottish mainland, m Shetland, in the Hebrides, and until lately in the Orkneys. The eggs are said to be always deposited very near the water's edge. They are two in number, of a greenisli brown colour, spotted with very dark brown, but, as Mr. Yarrell states, when the egg has been long sat upon the brown groundcolour is apt to assume a chestnut, or dark reddish-brown tint. III.\\u2014 ALCAD^. 279. COMMON GUILLEMOT\\u2014 (f/'nr/ Iroile). Foolish Guillemot, \\\"VVillock, Tinkershere, Tarrock, Scout, Sea- Hen, Murre, Lavy. \\u2014 The first on the list of our Ptockbirds, as they are often called. It is remarkable in several particulars connected with its breeding peculiarities. It makes no nest and lays but one egg, but that an egg of huge dimensions as contrasted with the size of the bird itself; besides which, it is almost impossible out of a collection of many scores to pick out half a dozen that are precisely alike, either in ground-colour or general markings. The eggs are laid on the ledges of rocky precipices overhanging the sea, on various parts of the British coasts. 1 have frequently seen the \\\"VVDlocks under the impulse of a sudden alarm \\u2014 for instance, the firing of a gun in the close vicinity of their egg-bestrown ledges \\u2014 fly off in very large numbers and with every symptom of precipitation. But no egg is ever dislodged ; a cii'cumstance which some Have sought to account for on the supposition that they must be cemented to the rockj The explanation really is, it would seem, that the shape of the eggs is such that, instead of rolling off in any direction, as a :.all would do on being sufficiently moved, they simply turn round ana vour.i witliin the length of their own axis. It would serve 154 BKlTlin BIRDS, TUEIR EGGS AXD NESTS. but little purpose to attempt a description of the Guillemot's figg. They are of all shades, from nearly or quite white to a dark green, some profusely spotted and blotched and streaked with, dark colours, others very slightly so or scarcely at all. Unfortunately the egg is so large that but two illustrations can be given in the limited space available to us. \\u2014 Fiff. 1, 2, j}late X. 280. BRUNNICH'S GUILLEMOT\\u2014 (Z7n\\u00ab Brunnichii). Thick-billed Guillemot. \\u2014 Easily distinguished by an experienced eye from the last, but a bird of which, perhaps, it can scarcely be said that it has been actually ascertained to breed any where within the limits of the British Isles. The eggs are described as varying from those of the Common Guillemot in their greater roundness ; they are less long in proportion to their thickness than the others, but seem to run through the sanitj endless variations of ground-colour. 281. RINGED GUILLEMOT\\u2014 (^/-/^ lacrpnans). Bridled Guillemot. \\u2014 There has been some doubt whether this bird is to be considered a distinct species, or merely a variety of the Common Guillemot. It is now, however, generally admitted as a good species. It occurs in company with the other Guillemot on various parts of our coasts, and in Wales is said to be equally numerous with it. The eggs are distinguishable from those of the other two species already named, but still exhibiting precisely similar characteristics. 282. BLACK GUILLEMOT\\u2014 (6Vi\\u00ab^;y//e). Tyste, Seraber, Greenland Dove, Sea Turtle. \\u2014 Sensibly less in size than the Common Guillemot, and not found commonly on our more southerly coasts. Shetland, the Orkneys and Western Isles are all frequented by thcin, and their quick and lively motions are pleasant enough to witness. These birdv lay two eggs each instead of one, in holes or crevices of pre\\u00ab PUFHN. 135 cipitous rocks, and at some distance from the aperture ; sometimes, where no such nest-sites are available, on the bare ground, under or between fragments of rock or large stones. They are most commonly white more or less tinged with blue, specklea, spotted and blotched or marbled with chestnut brown, very dark brown and a kind of neutral tint. \\u2014 Fig. 3, plate X. 283. LITTLE A.\\\\]K\\u2014(Merffidus melanoleucos). I have rarely seen any bird, much more a very small bird like this, whose whole air and deportment conveyed to me more completely the idea of entire independence. Only under the pressure of severe storms or long continued hard weather do they leave the deep sea in order to seek the comparative shelter of some land-sheltered bay or reach. It breeds on the Faroe Isles and in Iceland, but not in Britain. 284. '2'[]Y'Sl'^\\u2014{Fra(ercula arctica). Sea Parrot, Coulterneb, Tammy Norie. \\u2014 This is, one may safely say, the quaintest-looking of all the host of our Enghsh birds. The young Owl is grotesque enough, but more by reason of its deliberate, solemn-seeming and yet laughable movements; but the P uffin , with its upright attitude and liuge ribbed and painted beak \\u2014 reminding one somewhat strongly of the highly-coloured pasteboard noses of preposterous shape and dimensions wliich decorate the windows of the toy-shop \\u2014 strikes us as more laughably singular yet. They breed abundantly about many of our rocky coasts m all parts of the kingdom, depositing their one egg \\u2014 a large one, again, in proportion to the size of the bird \\u2014 sometimes in crannies or rifts in the surface of the cliff, often very far back ; at other times in rabbit-buiTows where such excavations ore to be met with sufficiently near the coast and otherwise suitable to the wants of the bird. It does not foUow that because the Puffin occupies tlie hole, that the rabbit had forsaken it or 156 BRITISH BIRDS, THEIR EGGS AND NESTS. even given it up \\\" for a consideration.\\\" On tlie contrary tlie Puffin is quite ready and equally able to seize on and continue to occupy the desired home by force of arms. In other cases they dig their own holes, and often excavate them to the depth of two or three feet. The eggs are nearly white before they become soiled \\u2014 that is spotted and marbled with a tinge of ash colour. 2S5. llAZOR-BILL~(Alca torda). llazor-bill Auk, Black-billed Auk, Murre, Marrot. \\u2014 It may almost be said that wherever the Guillemot is met with the Razor-bill is sure not to be far distant. They have their habits their food, their haunts, even to a great degree their general appearance, in conunon. There is, however, a great difference both in the shape and size and also in the colouring of the single egg laid by the Hazor-blll, from that of the Willock. It is less in proportion, less elongated, wants the infinite diversity of colouring which characterises the cg^ of the latter, the ground-colour being always whitish or white tinged with some light buffy shade, and the spots and blotches, which are siifficiently abundant, are some of a reddish or chestnut brown, others of a very deep rich brown. \\u2014 Fig. 4, flute X. 2S0. GREAT AUK\\u2014 (^/crt impemis). Gair-Fowl. \\u2014 Not merely an exceedingly rare British bird, but It is to be feared, extinct as a British species. Where it is yet ia existence it is said scarcely ever to leave the water, and it lays its one large egg almost close to high-water mark. These eggt are white in ground, or sometimes soiled or slightly yellowish wliite, blotched and streaked, most at the larger end, with black. They somewhat resemble the Guillemot's (^g in shape, but are rather less elongated. The value of these eggs is aimost suAG, L57 fabulous, sixty guineas* bavinej been given for a couple of them. I have to thank Mr. Chanipley, C.E., of Scarborough, for most kindly sending me an engraving of a Great Auk's egg in his possession, as well as for offering me access to his admirable coilection of eggs, numbering upwards of SOOO specimens. IV.\\u2014 PELECANID^.. 287. CO^mON COmiOTyKNT\\u2014iP/ialacrocorai: carlo). Crested Cormorant, Corvorant, Great Black Cormorant, Cole Goose, Skart. \\u2014 \\\"V^Hierever there are any traces of a rocky coast about our island, there the Cormorant is pretty sure to be found, so that he may very well be described as a common bird. Where the rocky coast is not only extensive, but not liable to much disturbance from human intrusion, these birds abound, and may be seen in numbers and observed to anyone's heart's content- They build their nests, which arc of ample size, with sticks, seaweed and coarse herbage of any obtainable sort, on ledges of the precipices ; and many nests are usually formed in the near neighbourhood of each other. They are much disposed also to select as the situation for their nests a rocky islet with cliffy sides, and woe to the nose of anyone who approaches such an island-rock from the leeward side. What from the nature of their food and the abundance of their excrement, an intolerably fetid odour always prevails about their breeding-place. The eggs vary in number from four to six, and are almost entirely covered over with a white chalky incrustation, which, however, admits of easy removal by a knife or similar means, leaving a shell of a bluishgreen colour apparent. 2S8.

Green Cormorant, Crested Cormorant, Crested Shag. \\u2014 A \\u2022 Morria's Nestg and Eggs of British Birds, 158 BRITISTI BIRDS, THEIR EGGS AND NESTS. smaller bird than the last, but easily distingmshable by that and iif prevailing green colour. As to habits and haunts the differences are not great. The Shags are said to breed lower down on the rocks than the Cormorant, and the nests are principally composed of sea weed and grasses. The eggs are three to five in number, and covered with the same incrustation as those of the Cormorant, and equally removable. White at first, they soon become as soiled and stained as tliose of the Grebes. 2S9. GANNET.\\u2014 (/S^fe Bassana). Solan Goose. \\u2014 Common enougli in certain localities, though the localities in which they occur vary with the season. When the breeding time comes round, they congregate in hosts of many thousands at some half-dozen different stations, particularly affected by them on different parts of our coasts. During the breeding season they become exceedingly tame, and wiU even suffer themselves to be touched. Tliey make their nests of a large mass of sea weed and dry grass, on rather than in which they lay each one single tg^, of no very considerable size. This, when first laid, is white or bluish-white, (the colour being dae to an incrustation similar to that of the Cormorant's egg), but soon becomes soiled and stained. v.\\u2014 LAEID^. 290. CASPIAN TEllN\\u2014 (67fra\\u00ab Caspta). The first member of the last Family of British birds, comprising many birds of habits and peculiarities as widely distinct, when it is remembered they are all water-birds, from those of the two Families last nader notice, as is readily conceivable. The Grebes, Divers, Cormorants, all gifted with wonderful powers of diving; the Gulls and Terns incapable of diving an inch; the latter, buoyant and bitting as lightly on the water as a cork ; the former deep-sunken ROSEATE TERN. 15^ in the water, and seeming to require almost an effort to support themselves on the surface at all. The contrast is certainly sufficiently striking, \\u2022vrlthout taking into account that the one group has immense power of flight, and exercises it ; and the others seem to have little inclination to use their wings at all, more than is absolutely necessary. The handsome and large Tern, specially under notice, does not breed in this country, but is known to inhabit the coast of some parts of the European continent, at no great distance from our own shores. 291.--SAND-WICII TI^'R'N\\u2014iS/erna Cantiaca). This bird has been noticed as breeding in several different localities on our southern coasts, and it is known to frequent both Coquet Island and one or more of the Fame Islands for the same purpose. It lays three or four eggs in a hole, or rather cavity, either scratched or found ready-made in the neighbourhood of plants or herbage sufScient to afford some covert. The colour of the eggs varies from yellowish white to a buffy stonecolour, and they are thickly spotted with neutral tint, chestnut and deep rich brown. There is, indeed, considerable variat ion m the colouring of the eggs, but all are very beautiful. \\u2014 Fig. ], 2, vlate XI. 292. ROSEATE TEK^\\u2014 {Sterna Doyffallii). This bird is now known to be a regular but not abundant summer visitor. Unlike many of our recognised British Birds, this Tern seems rather to increase in numbers than to diminish. They associate with other and infinitely more common species, and closer observation only lias distinguished between them and their eggs and those of their more numerous associates. The eggs of the Roseate Tern are two or three in number, and vary among themselves to some small extent. They are usually of a 160 BRITISH BIRDS, THEIR EGGS AND NESTS. liglit yellowish stone-colour, spotted and speckled with dark-p;re? and dark-brown. 293. COMMON TERN\\u2014 (<S/\\u00ab-\\u00ab\\u00ab hirundo). Sea Swallow, Tarney or Pictamey, Tarrock, Pirr, Gull-teazer, &c. \\u2014 ^Although distinguished by the epithet of Common, this Tern is really not much more numerous, and in that sense common, than one or two other species with which it customarily consorts. It is very generally diffused however, and in that sense w common. It usually biulds on the ground in marshy localities near large sheets of water, or on islands low and flat not far from the sea. Sometimes, though more rarely, it builds upon low rocks or slightly elevated sand-banks. They lay two or three eggs, and are exceedingly and noisily restless and uneasy when they, or especially their yoiuig, are too nearly approached. Their eggs vary a good deal, but most of them are of a medium stone-colour, blotched and spotted with ash-grey and dark red-brown. The buoyancy and power of flight exhibited by these birds is very observable. \\u2014 Fij. 3, 'plate XT. ARCTIC TERN\\u2014 (iS^eraa ardica). This Tern, until a comparatively recent period, was confounded with the Common Tern, but a clear specilic difference was pointed out by M. Temmiuck, and it is now acknowledged that, in maiiy of the more nortlierly localities especially, it is a much more numerous species than the Common Tern. It breeds plentifully m Shetland, Orkney and some parts of the Hebrides, and in great numbers on Coquet Island and one or more of the Fames. It lays two or three eggs, which are exceedingly like those of tiie Common Tern, and vary in the same proportion. Some have 3 ijreenish shade, and others rather a pronounced buff, spotted and BUCK TERN. 161 blotched as ;n the case of those of the last-named specica. \\u2014 Fig. 4, plate XI. 295.

Lesser Sea Swallow, Jjittle Tern. \\u2014 A pretty \\u2014 almost a delicate \\u2014 nttle bird, and not infrequent on such parts of oui- coasts as are adapted to its habits. It seems to prefer sand or shinglebanks or surfaces, and lays its two or three eggs in any small cavity which it may be lucky enough to find in the selected place. It is perfectly surprising in many cases how closely the eggs laid resemble the stones and gravel among which they are laid. They are palish stone-colour, speckled and spotted with ash-grey and dark brown. \\u2014 Fig. 5, plate XI. 298. BLACK TEK^\\u2014iSierna nigra). Blue Darr. \\u2014 These birds show considerable varieties in plumage, according to sex and age. They used to be very much more numerous than they now are, many of their favourite haunts having been drained or otherwise broken up. Still it is not uncommon, even yet, in some parts of the fenny districts \\u2014 g'.though other Terns build in the close vicinity of the sea, atid in dry sites. The Black Tern, however, selects marshy places and often builds in very wet spots, making a nest of flags and grass. The eggs are sometimes four in number, this being the only Tern which lays more than three. They vary much in colour and markings, some being of a palish green, others of a brownish yellow, or dull buff, but all spotted and blotched with deep brown.

Brown-headed Gull, Red-legged Gull, Laughing Gull, Pewit Gull, Black-cap, Sea Crow, Hooded Mew. \\u2014 This is a very numerous, and at least, at some periods of the year, a very generally diffused species. At the breeding time, although a few pairs may be met with in an infinite number of localities, the great bulk of the species seems to collect at a few chosen places. One such place, in wliich they breed in thousands, is on Scoulton Mere, in Norfolk ; another at PaUinsburn, in Northumberland ; and a tliird, in Lincolnsliire, not fur from Brigg. The nests are made of sedges, grass and the flowering part of the reed, and are not very deeply cup-sliaped. The bird lays three eggs, and there is a very great degree of variation between them in respect of colour and markings ; the ground-colour being sometimes of a light blue or yellow, and sometimes green, or red, or brown. Some, too, are thickly covered with spots, and others scarcely marked with a single speckle or spot. In more than one of their great COMMON GULL. 103 breeding-places the right or gathering the eggs is rented, and sonaetimes upwards of a thousand eggs are collected in a single day. When the first laying of eggs is taken, a second batch, and even a third is produced ; but in each successive instance, the eggs become less. They are used as the Pewit's eggs are, and also for culinary purposes, being sold for about fivepence a score. \\u2014 Fig. 7, plate XI. 304. LAUGHING-GULL\\u2014 (Z\\u00abrK5 atricilla).

It places its nest of sea-weed high up on the face of some rocky steep on a narrow ledge, and deposits therein, for the most part, three eggs. These differ much in colour and in the amount and position of the spots ; some are stone-coloured, some tinged with an olive shade, and some with a bluish cast.

I have seen it abundantly at Flamborough Head and St. Abb's Head, and in smaller numbers on many parts of the Yorkshire coast north of Flamborough, as well as in. others not distant from St. Abb's. It usually selects for the site of its nest a flat ledge or other rock-surface towards the upper part of the cliff ' but win sometimes build on a low rock or grassy island. Tht. nest is like that of the last species, but even larger, and usually contains three eggs. These so strongly resemble those of the Lesser Black-back as to make it very difficult to distingush between the one and the otlier. Mr. Hewitson says the only means of distinction available even to an experienced eye seem to depend on the somewhat greater size of the Herring Gull's egg, and the larger and more confluent character of the blotches of surface colour. \\u2014 Fig. 4, plate XII. 311. GREAT BLACK-BACKED Gl]l.L\\u2014(Larusmarinus). Black-back, Cob, Great Black-and-white GuU. \\u2014 By no means a numerous species, and not affecting society as so many of the other Gulls do. It breeds, in some cases, on the Marsh or Saltingspaces met with so abundantly on some, of the southern and eastern shores ; but more commonly on rocky parts of the coast. Thus, it breeds very abimdautly on the Orkney and Shetland Islands. Tlic nest is made of a large quantity cf dry grass simply thrown together. The eggs are three in number, often bearing a great resemblance to those of tlie two species last 166 BlUTISU BIRDS, TUEIU EGGS AND KES18. named, but usually distinguishable by the larger masses of surface colouring, and by some superiority in size. The Black back's eggs are much esteemed as articles of food, or for cooking purposes generally. The yolk is very deep and rich-coloured, and the white colourless or transparent. Each female wUl lay tliree sets of eggs ; the first two sets being, in some cases, customarily taken, and the last left for her to hatcn. 312. GLAUCOUS GJJLlj\\u2014iLarusfflaucus). Large White-winged GuU, Burgomaster. \\u2014 A GuU equally large with the last, one of which, shot by myself, exceeded six feet from the tip of one wing to that of the other ; but one of merely casual occurrence as a British bird. 313. COMMON SKUK\\u2014iLesMs catarrades). Skua GuU, Brown GuU, Bonxie. \\u2014 We pass here into a somewhat different class of birds. The Skua is as bold and insolent as most of the GuUs are timid and retiring. In many instances these birds do not take the trouble to fish for themselves, but, watching the fishing operations of the Gull, seize their opportunity of assailing a successful fisher, and compel him to disgorge his prey. The Common Skua has only a very limited breedmgrange in Britain, not beiag known to nest out of Shetland, and to have but three places for nidification there. So resolute and daring are they when they have young to defend, they do not scruple to attack the eagle, and a pair have been known to beat the strong, proud marauder effectually off. The Skua makes a large nest of moor-growing moss, and takes some pains in its construction. It is placed among the heath and moss of a hiUy island. The eggs are two in number, and vary much in coloui- ; according to locality it would almost seem. Some are dusky FULMAR PETREL. 167 olive brown, others with a much greener hue, and they are blotched with darker brown, and a few spots of rust colour. 314. POMARINE SKV A.\\u2014{Lestris Pomarinus). Merely a casual visitor, although more frequently noticed of late years than before ornithology became so favourite a study. 315. RICHARDSON'S SKUA\\u2014 (Zes^m Richardsonii). Arctic Gull, Black-toed Gull, Arctic Skua. \\u2014 This species is the most numerous of all those which visit this country. It breeds in the Hebrides, in the Orkneys and in Shetland, and numerously enough in the two localities last named. The female has been observed to make use of the same artifices as the Partridge and the Grouse to decoy an intrusive dog or man away from its nest or young. The nest is built of moss or ling, on some elevated knoll amid marshy ground, or on the moor, and coutaius two eggs. These are of a greenish olive-brown colour, spotted with dark browni. This Skua not only restlessly and pitilessly persecutes the Kittiwake and other Gulls in order to obtain its own food from them at second-hand, but also makes free with their eggs for the same purpose in a very marauder-like fashion. \\u2014 Fir/. 5, plate Xlf. 316. BUEEON'S SKUA\\u2014 (Ze^^m Buffonii). Mr. Yarrell distiaguishes between this bird and the true L. Parasiticus, and consequently adopts the scientific name I have now given. This Skua can only be considered a rare and accidental visitor. 317. FULMAR PETREL\\u2014 (P;-oceJ&r?\\u00ab glacialis). Fulmar, Northern Fulmar. \\u2014 The Fulmar breeds in incredible numbers at St. KUda, but is rarely met with, even in winter, about the southern coasts of England. Both old birds and their young on being touched eject a considerable quantity of 168 BRITISH BIRDS, THEIR EGGS AND XESTS. clear oil, v/hicli, however, is by no means of an agreeable odour ; and probably from this cause the nest, young birds, and even the rock on which they are placed, stink almost intolerably. The nest is very slight, if any, and the bird lays her single white egg in little excavations, and lightly lined, on such shelves on the face of high precipitous rocks as are surfaced with a little grass or sward. The egg varies in length from a Httle over 2i inches to 3 inches. 318. GREATER SHEARWATER\\u2014 (P#\\u00ab2\\u00ab major). Cinerous Shearwater, Dusky Shearwater. \\u2014 A bird which has not been very frequently recorded as met with on the British seas, but still one of occasional occiirrence. 319. :MANX SHEARWATER\\u2014 (P\\u00ab#\\u00abm5 Angiorum). Shearwater Petrel, Manx Puffin. \\u2014 This is a regular sea-taring little bird, and perhaps would hardly ever care to come to land if it weie not for the need of something solid for its eggs to repose upon. It usually frequents islands well-washed by the sea and not much frequented by men. It used to be very abundant on the Calf of Man, but is never seen there now. In one of the Scilly Islands it breeds in some numbers still, and on St. KUda, the Western Isles, Orkney and Shetland. The nest is made deep down in a hole in some wild and half inaccessible part of the islands frequented, and in it one egg ot exceeding whiteness is laid, and remarkable for the fine texture ot the shell amd the musky scent of the entire egg. It is about 2\\\\ inches long by 1| broad. 320. BULWER'S '\\u00a3'^TKEL\\u2014{Thalassidroma Bulwerii). A Petrel of sufficiently rare occurrence. 321. WILSON'S PETREL\\u2014 (7%tftes\\u00abc?ro\\u00bb?fl Wilsont). Equally rare with the bird last-named. STORM PETREV 169 322. FORK-TAILED VETnYL\\u2014iThahssidroma Leachii). Subject to tlie same remark as the two last. 323. STORM \\\"BETMli\\u2014^Thalassidroma procellaria). Mother Carey's Chicken. \\u2014 This is said to be the smallest webfooted bird known, and it is the last as well as the least. It nevei comes to the shore except at the breeding-season, and only seeks comparative shelter under the pressure of very heavy weather. It breeds in the SciUy Islands, some of the islands on the Irish coast, and abundantly on St. Kilda, the Orkneys and Shetland. They breed in holes in a cliff, or under large-sized stones, which, from their great size and the accumulation of boulders and large shingle about them, afford many deep recesses well suited to the wants of the nesting Petrel. Like the Manx Shearwater, they are by no means silent m. their nest-holes, but make themselves distinctly audible to the passenger above. They lay one white esrg, a little exceediag 1 inch long, by J nroad. * TJie simpUst and best way ofblovying eggs is to drill a hole in one side [not at the ends), then taking the egg, hole downwards, between the finger and thumb of the left hand, place the blowpipe pioint jicst outside the hole, and blow into the egg ; this will force out the contents. When this is done, blow a little clean water into the egg, and shake it well; then remove the \\\\oater in the same way as a.bove, and allow the egg to dry, hole downwards, on blotting paper ; it will then be quite clean. APPENDIX. Our object in adding this Appendix is simply a wish to make the book more complete by adding notices, more or less detailed, of the nests and eggs and any interesting breeding-season peculiarities of birds recognized as really well entitled to the name of British Birds, but not happening to remain within the limits of Britain to breed. The first bird of the kind i\\\" that which, in our complete list, is numbered 7. GREENLAND FAl.GON. The equivalent to Mr. Yarrell's Gyr Falcon. 8. ICELAND FALCON. These two species are now, I believe, looked upon as established, but the differences between them are not excessively striking, except it be to a scientific naturalist. Mr. Hewitson has figured an egg of tlie Iceland Falcon which he believes may have lost some of its colour. It was taken from a neat made with sticks and roots, lined with wool, which once perhaps was the nest of a Raven. The nest in question was in a cliff, and had the remains of manysortsof birds\\u2014 Whimbrels, Golden Plovers, GuUlemots, Ducks\\u2014 strewed round it. The egg is of a bufFy red colour, mottled and speckled\\u2014 very thickly in places\\u2014 with deeper red. 30. SNOWY OWL. SuflSciently often met withinNorth Britain (and even occurring sometimee in England) to merit a short notice here. It inhabits Sweden, Norway, Lapland and the greater part of Northern Europe. These birds are accustomed to take their prey by daylight, and seem, from the accounts received, to be 172 In the habit of\\\" bolting \\\" their food, when not vei-y largo, whole. It makes its nest on the ground, and lays in it three or four white eggs. 54. GREAT GEEY SHRIKE. This bird is met with in Denmark and other northern countries of Western Europe, and also in Russia, Germany and France, It is said to frequent wocds and forests, and to build upon trees at some distance from the ground, as well as in thick bushes and hedges. The nest is made of roots, moss, wool and dry stalks, lined with dry grass and root-fibres. The eggs are four to seven in number, and though they vary a good deal in colour, they always illustrate the peculiar tendency of the eggs of the Shrikes to show a sort of zone or girdle, due to the agglomeration of the spots about some part of the circumference. They are yellowish or greyish white, and the spots of grey and light brown. 42. FIELDFARE. I have sometimes seen this favourite game-bird of the sohool-boy here as early as the latter part of September, and I have frequently noticed them foeding in hundreds on the holly berries which abound in more than one part of this district. They must breed very late in the year from the late period of their departure hence, and the distance of the countries to which many of them resort for that purpose. It breeds very abundantly in Norway, and also in Sweden, Russia and Siberia, not to mention other and more southerly countries in Europe. Their nests, in Norway, are usually bailt ^gainst the trunk of the spruce-fir, and at very variable heights from the ground. They are said to be very like those of the Ring Ouzel, except that small twigs are added to th^i outside structure. The eggs are from three to five, and are very like those of the Ring Ouzel, but with somewhat more red about them. The Fieldfare seems to prefer breeding in numerous groups or colonies, two or three hundi ed nests oeuig frequently seen within a i'ather limited space. 43.' REDWING. This winter visitor is known to breed occasionally, but yet only very excopt'onally, in this country. A nest was brought to me two summers since, whicli, from its construction, the size and cokuring of the eggs, and espotially from the description of the bird which my informal. t saw leaving th\\u00ab APPENDIX. 173 D\\u00ab8t, I have little doubt was a Redwing. It breeds abundantly in Sweden and in lesser niimbexs in Norwaj , and is described as being a very sweet su;ger, as heard among the forest solitudes of the latter country. Its nest is very similar to those of the Blackbird, Ring Ouzel and Fieldfare, in materials and structure. The eggs are four to six in number, and very similar, allowing for a little inferiority in size, to those of the Fieldfare, and to very red specimens of the Uing Ouzel's. 91. SNOW BUNTING This bird resorts in the breeding-season to the \\\" Arctic Regions and tlie Islands of the Polar Sea.\\\" Mr. Yarrell says, \\\" the nest is composed of dry grass, neatly lined with deers' hair and a few feathers, and is generally fixed in a crevice of a rock, or in a loose pile of timber or stones. The eggs are a greenish white, with a circle of irregular umber-brown spots round the thick end, and numerous blotches of subdued lavender purple.\\\" 98. MOUNTAIN FINCH. This Finch is occasionally met with in sufficient numbers to be deserving of a short notice here. It seems to breed in Denmark, Norway, and Lapland, and it is at least possible that a few pairs may, from time to time, stay to nest with us. It is said to build in fir-trees, though from Mr. Hewitsou's account, the nests are by no means easy to find. The following is an account of a nest made by a pair in an aviary at Becclcs in Suffolk : \\u2014 \\\" Tlie nest was deep, the walls thick, a large quantity of materials employed for the foundation which was worked among the stalks of the ivy-leaves. It was composed of moss, wool, and dry grass ; and lined with hair.\\\" The general appearance of the eggs is one of resemblance to those of the Chaffinch ; the spots however, seeming to be fewer, smaller and less decided. 104,. SISKI.X. This little bird lias been known in several instances to breed with us in its natural wild condition, but its nesting-home is in Russia, Germany and north-western Europe. It has been ascertained to build in furze bushes, and also close to the trunk of a fir-tree, where a projecting bough afforded support for the structure. The nest is composed of similar materials to the Chaffinchs', and the eggs present a good deal of resemblance to those of the Goldfinch, with a little inferiority in size. l74 170. TURNSTONE. This very handsomely pIumap;od. bird inhabits the countries bordering on the Baltic, as also Greenland and other localities far to the north. Mr. Hewitson gives a most interesting account of his discovery of its nest i\\u00bb Norway : \\u2014 \\\" We had visited numerous islands with little encouragemerand were about to land upon a flat rock, when our attention was attractet by the singular cry of a Turnstone. We remained in the boat a short tims until we had watched it behind a tuft of grass, near which after a minute search, we succeeded in finding the nest. It was placed against a ledge <x. the rock, and consisted of nothing more than the dropping leaves of the Juniper bush, under a creeping branch of which the eggs, four in number, were snugly concealed and sheltered.\\\" Several other nests were also found in the course of further researches, which, however, were required to be both close and systematic. The eggs are of an olive-green colour, spotted and streaked with different shades of red-brown, and \\\" all having a beautiful tint of purple or crimson, seen in few other eggs.'' 171. SANDERLING. It breeds in Greenland, Labrador and other Arctic countries. It makes its nest on marshy grounds, of grass, and lays four \\\" dusky- coloured eggs, spotted with black.\\\" But little seems to be known of either the nidification or the eggs of this species, as no figure is given by either Mr. Hewitson or in the Reverend O. Morris's book. 237. HOOPER. Occasionally met with during the breeding season in Iceland, and more commonly in Lapland. They are described as inhabiting the most remote and inaccessible lakes and morasses in forest districts. The nest is made of any coarse water herbage which is suitable and at the same time accessible. It is large, and raised some inches above the surface of the supporting soil. The eggs are believed to be from three or four to seven in number, and are usually of a uale brownish white colour, extending to about 4 inches long by 2J broad. 245. PINTAIL. This Duck breeds in Iceland, and commonly in Lapland and some of the iistricts about the Gulf of Bothnia. It builds, like most others of its kind APPENDIX. 175 among the thick herbage commonly growing near the edge of pieces of fresh water; the nest being made of tlie same, but dry, and lined with down. The eggs are six to eight or nine in number, and are of a light greenish white colour, and about the same size as those of the Wild Duck proper. 265. VELVET SCOTER. This Sea Duck is found in Russia, Norway, the Faroe Islands, and also in Iceland. Mr. Audubon's account of its nest and eggs is as follows :\\u2014 \\\" The nests are placed within a few feet of the borders of small lakes, a mile or two from the sea, and usually under the low boughs of the bushes, of the twigs if which, with mosses and various plants matted together, they are formed f hey are large and almost flat, several inches thick, with some feathers of the female, but no down, under the eggs, which are usually six in number, 2J inches in length, by If in breadth, of an uniform pale cream colour, tinged with green.\\\" 256, COMMON SCOTER. It breeds, but not very numerously, in Iceland ; but is seen nesting in company with the Velvet Scoter, in Scandinavia, rather more commonly. It makes a nest of any available vegetable substance, such as grasses, twigs, leaves, dry stalks ; it is lined with down, and placed under the partial cover or concealment afforded by low shrubs or other plants. The eggs are six or seven to ten in number, of a pale buff colour slightly tinged with green, 2i inches long by If broad. After the eggs are laid, the males aseemble in large flocks and draw towairds the coast. 259. POCHARD. The breeding-haunt of this bird seems to be more to the eastward than the mojority of those hitherto named. It is said to be abundant in Russia and in the north of Germany, and is very commonly found in the Fur-countries in America during the breeding-season. A few also breed on the Borders of the Meres in Holland. The nest is similar in site and materials to those of the Wild Duck and other Ducks, and the eggs sometimes reach the nimaber of twelve. They are of a greenish buff colour, 2 inches in length, by H in breadth. The Pochard was discovered, several years since 176 APPENDIX as breeding about the mere at Scarborough, and has also been stated to nest occasionally in one or two places in Tforfolk. 281. SCAUP DUCK. This Duck has also been known as breeding very incidentally in this coun\\u00ab. try, but its almost unbroken habit is to return to such countries as Iceland, the swampy lake-district north of the GiJf of Bothnia, and some parts of Norway, for nesting purposes. It sometimes makes its nest in wliat may be almost called the usual site for the nests of Ducks, and sometimes upon the stones and shinglo at the edge of sheets of fresh water. The nest is very thin and slightly formed, but well lined with down, and the eggs seem to be six, seven, or eight in number, They are of a pal 3 bulT colour, and sensibly less in size than those of the Pochard last named. 262. TUPTED DUCK. This little Duck is known to breed near the head of the Bothnian Gulf, as well as in oth er parts of Sweden, and in Lapland and Russia. A few pairs also are seen nesting in Holland. It makes a very slight nest of grasses and the like. The eggs are seven or eight to ten in number, very similar in shade to those of the Scaup Duck last mentioned, but much less in size, being only a little over 2 inches long, by less than 1\\\\ in breadth. 263. LONG-TAILED DUCK. It is known to breed in Iceland, and believed to do so in Norway. It makes its nest among low brushwoou and the herbage usual at or near tho margin of fresh water. A few stems of grass Ibrm the substructure, on which is placed a plentiful lining of down. The eggs are from six to twelve in number. They art of yellowish-white, just tinged with green, and nearly 2| inches long by IJ in breadth. 265. GOLDEN EYE. This Duck seems to prefer wooded or forest districts for nesting in. It breeds in Lapland, Sweden and Norway, and has such a strong liking for a hole in a tree to nest in, that if suitable boxes with an adequate entrance- AJr'PENUIX. 177 hole are placed <ai the trees growing on the banks of streams or lakes frequented by them, their eggs are su ro io be deposited therein, to the great profit of those who suspend theboxes. Of course when it isknowu that aDuck hatches its young in a hole in a tree, the question must suggest itself\\u2014 as it did to the original obserrer in the ease of the Wild Ducks' nest on a pollard, or in a Fir-tree \\u2014 How can the young Ducks ever be got down safely, and still more, finally launched on their proper element ? An observed habit of the Golden Eye answers this question. A Lap clergyman saw the parent bird conveying its young, to the number of five or more, but one at a time, from the nest to the water, and he was at last able to \\\" make out that the young bird was held under the bill, but supported by the neck of the parent.\\\" The eicgs of the Golden Eye are said to be ten or twelve or oven more in number, Hiid of a brighter colour than is usual with the eggs of the Duck tribe, being of a rather decided green colour. 267. SMEW. But little that is quite authentic seems to be known of the nesting habits of this little Duuk; nor is it certainly ascertained where its chief numbers retire to breed. The esgs are said to be eight or ten in number, or even more than that, and to be of a yellowish white colour. 270. GREAT NORTHERN DIVER. This bird breeds on the Faroe Islands, and on some of the lakes in Iceland ; as also on some of the islands of Finmark. Spitzbergen and Greenland are also named as the breeding resort of many of these Divers. They lay, it is supposed, two eggs each, though in some observed instances only one was to be seen. Mr. Audubon says that three are sometimes laid. They are of a dark olive-brown, with a few spota of dark umber brown, and are of considerable size \\u00a3S3. LITTLE A^JK, This little wave-dwclIer has its nesting home in countries far more r.o tho North than ours. It abounds on some parts cf the Greenland shores, and it is also met with but much more sparingly, iu Iceland. It makes no nest\\u00bb M ilS ArPENDlX. but lays its one egg on the ground amongst or possibly beneath the large rock-masses which encumber the shore after falling from the overhanging cliffs and precipices. The parent birds are exceedingly averse to leave theii egg when incubation has commenced, and like some other species already mentioned, will rather suffer themselves to be removed by the hand. Tha egg is white lightly tinged with blue, a little spotted and veined with rual colour. INDEX. Accentor, Alpine, 63. Auk Little, 155. Great, 15fi. Bivoeet, 125. Bee-Eater, 98. Blackbird, 51.

MOORE'S BRITISH FERNS. With Coloured Plates. scU\\\" PREFACE. TuE object proposed in this volume is, in the first place, to present our young readers with a complete and systematic list of oui Britisli Birds : \\u2014 the word British being taken to mean such aSj being truly wild birds, either inhabit Britain throughout the year^ visit Britain statedly for longer or shorter periods of each year, or have been proved to reach the shores of Britain two or three times or oftener, under the pressure of any incidental circumstances whatever. In the next place, the attempt has been made to distmguisli at once between the rare or casual visitors, and such as are really denizens of the Land, whether for a few weeks or months aimualiy, or by unbroken habitation. But the principal object and intention of the book is to present Qoonooa PREFACE, accurate and trustworthy accounts of the Nests and Nesting-sites the Eggs, and any ascertained nesting or breeding-season peculiarities of every undoubtedly British-breeding species. And thb author's difficulty has often been out of the large mass of available materials at his command, acquired by personal observation or from the reading and notes of many years, to select what might be instructive, interesting or amusing, without bm-dening the book with unnecessary details, or encroachmg too much on the allotted space. The principle adopted in the illustrations has been to omit all representations of eggs either white or nearly white in colour-, in order to husband space for the admission ot a greater number of those characterised by varied colours and marldngs. On the same ground, although it was earnestly desired by the artist to give more than one representation of some of the very marked variations occurring in the eggs of several species, he has been compelled to content himself with selecting and figuring the most typical or normal forms in all such cases. AH the illustrations given have be^ carefully drawn from unquestionable specimens, and Mr. Coleman desires to acknowledge in this place the assistance, which in this matter, has been afforded him by that excellent and accurate practical naturalist, Mr. Y. Bond. PREFACE. VU An Appendix is subjoined, in wluch a notice will be found of the habits of nidification, the nests and eggs of several birds, which though regular inhabitants of Britain or soiiie part of it, for a given portion of each year, still retire to foreign and distant localities for the purposes of nest-making and rearing their young. Finally, an attempt has been made to exhibit at one glance, and iu a very condensed and systematic form, as much information as possible touching the nest, its customary site and materials, and also the eggs, their number, colour, and markings, and any noteworthy breeding peculiarities of each separate British-breeding species.. ] t is hoped this attempt, somewhat novel as it is, and almost inevitably imperfect as it must be in some respects, will not be regarded as altogether unacceptable by the youthful nest-hunter and egg-coUector. The author has only to obseiTc, in conclusion, that he has scarcely thought it necessary in the majority of instances to notice the common and well recognised fact that the particular species under notice, iu common with many or most of our common British Birds, rears two broods, or even more, in the course of the summer. Neither has he thought it requisite to attempt to PREFACE define the average season for the commencement of nidificatlon in the case of this or that species, as they came successively under review. INTRODUCTORY CHAPTERS. ClIAPTEE I. TuE object with wliich this book is written is tliat it may be interesting and useful to young egg-collectors. It is not easy to make a book, which is to be devoted to such details as the length and breadth and sliadcs and markings of some two or three hundred different eggs, eitlier interesting, or even barely readable. But there is no necessity that a book of British birds' eggs and nests should be devoted to merely such details as those. For my own part, 1 do not find it easy altogether to dissociate the eggs laid from tlie bird which lays them ; and when I see a beautiful nest, I can hardly help being led to think something about the builder, its means, objects, powers, instincts and intelligence. And I don't see why a book about eggs and nests should not follow the direction given by those same objects to my thoughts, and the thoughts of hundreds and thousands of other men besides me, and I am sui-e too ol hundreds and thousands of boys and girls as well. I am as sui-e as if I could see into the minds of many and many a young nest-hunter, that when he finds one day the wonderfully neat and beautiful Chaiiinch's or Goldfinch's or Crested Wren's nest, and the ncAt, lights upon some littering Jackdaw's nest, or B 2 BRITISH BIRDS, THEIR EGGS AND KES7S. inartistic, careless-seeming Jay's or E-iiig-dove's, that the wide, wonderful contrast and diiference sets him thinking \\u2014 What is the reason of this strange dissimilarity ? Is one of these birds really less clever than the other ? Did God make one of them a careless, disorderly, unthrifty bird, while the other He mado such a wonderfully neat and dexterous and contriving one ? And I am equally sure that a little measui-e of observation and thought wUl be enough to show the young inquirer not only that the Great Maker of Birds and Giver of their instincts and imderstandings and capacities has not left some of His creatures imperfect in some of their qualifications and endowments, but that the very contrasts and unlikenesses which first set liim on questioning at all, all teach one great lesson and illustrate one great truth, \\u2014 namely this, \\\" Lord, how manifold are Thy works ! In wisdom hast Thou made them all.\\\" Perhaps an Egg-book might be so written as to help such thought and observation as is here supposed, and now and then besides to suggest explanations or lead to investigation or commumcate a knowledge of facts such as to illustrate and make cleai, and even entertaining or amusing, the every day incidents and facts which fall commonly enough beneath the notice of the moderately sharp-eyed and observant nest-hunter. The difficulty of making such a book useful to the systematic collector of eggs, however yoimg, is not nearly as great as that of making it interesting to the many, who, tliough not inspired with the ambition of owning a real grand cabinet, and of arranging its manifold drawers with neatly ordered and ticketed egg-cards, are yet sensible of a real pleasure and enjoyment in noticing the nests and eggs of their numerous \\\"feathered friends,\\\" and identifying such as may chance to be less familiarly known than the majority of those met with under ordinary INTRODUCTORY CHAPTERS. 3 circumstances. Faithful description and accurate representation are clearly witliin oiu' reach, and such description and representa\\u00bb tion are sufficient in nineteen cases out of twenty for the purposes of identification in all instances of usual occurrence. The cases in which identification is difficult are of two or ibree kinds. Sometunes the difficulty arises from the near resemblance of the eggs laid by different allied species, sometimes rroni the wide discrepancies in the markings and especially in the sliadiugs or tints of eggs laid by the same species ; but much more frequently from the doubtful eggs being met with apart from the containing nests, or from want of proper or sufficiently accurate observation of the nests at the moment of discovery. The young egg-fancier should always recollect that the fashion and materials and site of the nest taken in connection with the eggs will almost always, with the aid of a tolerably accurate and well illustrated Book of Eggs, enable him to decide without hesitation as to the real owner of the nests and eggs in question ; while there are very many eggs, such as the Common Wren's, those of one or more of the Tom-tits, the Lesser Willow-Wren &c., of which specimens may be found so nearly resembling one another in shade and size and spots, that it requires a very nice and experienced eye to allot the several eggs to their certain origin. In such a case as this, recoui'se must be had to some kind and experienced Oologist. A few words on another subject. The author has been gravely taken to task by some of his conscientious friends, for delineating in one or two of his former books the pleasures and excitements of egg-hunting, or the satisfaction of trying to form a methodical collection. He has been more than once asked \\u2014 Do you really mean to encourage boys in robbing birds' nests ? Can fou defend such a practice from the charge of cruelty P 4 BRITISH BIRDS, THEIR EGGS AND MESTS. If I thought there was any real or necessary connection between a love of egg-hunting \\u2014 yes, and egg-collecting, too, \\u2014 and cruelt3', 1 would not say another word for it or about it. But I am sure that the real lover of birds and their nests and eggs is not the boy who is chargeable with those torn and ruined nests \\u2014 \\\" destroyed \\\" as they may well be styled \\u2014 which grieve one as he walks along tlie lanes and hedge sides. If the nest is taken, or rudely and roughly handled, or tlie eggs aU plundered, there is cruelty : for in the one case, the poor parent-birds are warned by their instinct, if not their intelligence, to forsake their treasured charge ; in the other, they suffer from pitiless robbery of what they most love. But if the parent bird be not rudely and repeatedly driven from her nest, \\u2014 if the nest be not pidled out of shape, or the containing bushes or environing shelter be not wilfully or carelessly disturbed \\u2014 if two or three eggs are still left for her to incubate, there is, so far as human observation can reach, no pain, or concern, or uneasiness, to the little owners from the abstraction of one egg or more, and, therefore, of course, no cruelty in the abstraction. The legitimate pursuit of sport in the stubbles and turnip fields, or on the open moor, does not differ more widely from the cruel proceedings of tlie cold-blooded, hard-hearted slaughterer of his dozens of Rock-birds (many of which are always left to die lingeringly and miserably), than the object or manner of action of the true lover of birds and their ways and nests tjid eggs, trom the rutliless destruction of every nest and its contents which may happen to be met with by some young loutish country savage. Again, a few words more, and this time about ciassificatiora. I should like, if such a course were profitable, or even practicable, to make just such a classification as an active, sharp-eyed^ observant, persevering nest-hunter would, %s it were, find ready- INTKOUUCTOia CllAl'TERS. 5 made for liiin, by the results of his rambles and investigations and discoveries ; tliat is to say, to group the birds and their ep;gs according to their frequent occinTence, their comparative, but still not positive, iufrequency, or their downriglit rarity. By this means, ana the subdivisions which would be suggested by an enumeration oi the most usual sites of the several nests, an interesting, and at least partially instructive as well as good, system of classification would be devised. But I am afraid such a system would not have much to recommend it, besides its novelty and interest and practical hints \\\" where to look for this bird's nest or the other's ; and how to look so as to find.\\\" One great disadvantage would be that such classification, so called, would have the effect of brealdng up groups which uatui-e lias put together. There is, generally speaking, what may be called a great family-likeness between the eggs of the various species of any given genus, or kind of birds. Take the Buntings, for instance : any one who is familiar with the common YeUow-Hammer's egg would at once guess at the eggs of either of the other species as belonging to a Bunting ; and the same of the Titmice, Linnets, Thrushes, Crows, and so on without end. So that although it may seem at first sight that scientific classification is hard and troublesome and half umiecessary, and may often prompt the question in the boy-collector's mind. Why wouldn't it do just as well to write down the English names on the cards and in my catalogue, and arrange them all my own way ? still it should be remembered that such classification after all is far from arbitrary, and on the contrary, and as far as it is really good, only follows out the teachings or guidings of nature. And this quite independently of the trouble which is saved by it to any one who wishes to consult books of reference, and still more to examine large and well-arranged collections of eggs, whether 6 BRITISH BIRDS, TUEIR EGGS A.ND NESTS. for his own direct instruction, or merely in searcii of interesting pastime. If a boy only knows that a Reed-Sparrow is called a Reed-Sparrow or a Black-headed Bunting, and he wanted to find the Reed-sparrow's eggs in a well-stocked collection, he might be half-an-hour before he lit upon what he wanted ; but if he knew that the generic name of the Bunting was Emberiza, and the specific name of the Reed-Sparrow, Schoeniclus, he would be able to pitch upon his quarry in half-a-minute. Besides all which, no one was ever the worse for learning habits of orderly and systematic arrangement, even though he had to pay the price of doing a little puzzling head-achy work, and liad to bother himself with a good many ugly-looking, ill-souuding, jaw-cracking words, such as Coccothraustes, Troglodytes, Platyrhynca, Phalacrocorax, and the like. It is proposed in this little book to adopt a classification which seems to meet with very general acceptance or acquiescence, and principally for that reason ; \\u2014 that, namely, which was employed by the late Mr. TarreU. This classification depends on the system which divides all birds whatever into five great classes, viz : \\u2014 I. Raptores Prey-catchers. II. Insessores Perchers. III. Rasores Scratciiers. IV. Grallatores .... Waders, V. Natatores .... Swimmers. Kach of these classes, or \\\"Orders,\\\" as they are technically called, is again divided either into distinct Pamilies, or (at least in some cases) into Sub-classes, or Groups ; these Groups being then further subdivided into Famihcs. Again, these Families are made up of more or fewer genera, and each genus of more or INTRODUCTORY ClIAPTJiRS. 7 Tewer species. These species, so many of tliem as compose any particular genus, all differ from one another more or less, but yet have a strong general resemblance, or (what may familiarly be called) strong family likeness to each other. The general scheme or, as I may almost call it, the skeleton o\\u00a3 our classification will therefore stand thus : \\u2014 ORDER I.\\u2014 R^\\\\rTORES. Family I. Vulluridce'^ . . . Vulture-kind.

Wood-bkd-kind. \\u2022 Vtdttirid(P, Falconidw, and the other similar names of Families ara most of tlieni, Latin words, witli Greek forms or terminations. The true or real meaning of any one of them would be, that the l)irds in the Family so named are the children, or descendants, of the bird or birds whose name is used\\u2014 thus, Vulturidoe, sous of a Vulture or Vultures\\u2014 which, of course, is nonsense, as the words are applied. AVhat is meant by the use of the words in question is that the birds grouped together in any one Family, all participate in some likeness of kind \\u2014 are, so to speak, \\\" connections\\\" of each othe \\u2022 or that tliere is a sort of kin-sliip among them. This I have tried to convev in the annexed translation. It ouj,'ht to be observed also that the Bird whose name is given to the entire Family is selected for such purpose as possessing the characteristic qualities or peculiarities of the family in question, or, at least, most of them, in the strongest and most marked degree. t SylviadcB I have translated Wood-bird-kind, because Sylvia means something connected with wood, if it means anything. Sylvia is taken, in Bird-nomenclature, to denote a Warbler; and it may be said, that most of those birds whLch come under this division are Warblers in some sense, and are. in some degree or other, of sylvan habits; at least if wo give to tha word sylvan some latitude of meaning.

Any one who is conversant with Yarrell's admirable \\\" British Bu-ds,\\\" will most likely have noticed that that author givea in almost every case very precise measurements of the eggs of each particular species of Bird described. And it might, at first sight, seem to be so necessary to give such measurements that one would very likely feci half inclined to pronounce a Book of Birds' Eggs very imperfect, whicii omitted all notice of dimensions. But tlic fact is, such measurements are, in so very many different instances, altogether fallacious and likely to mislead. Thus I.Ir. Yai-rell's measurements of the Blackbird's egg are, \\\" the lengtli one incli, two lines ; the breadth ten lines.\\\" That is no doubt a good average or approximate measurement, but I have Blackbirds' eggs before me wliicli vary between half a line, or -^^ of an inch, less, and a line, or ^\\\\ of an incii, more in length, and between half a line, more or less, in breadth. Again, I have two Starlings' eggs on my table, both taken from the same Pigeon-cote, in Essex; one of which is l-^^s iiicli long by |\\u00a7 inch broad; the other 1-^ inch long, and fg inch broad; while to tlie eye the latter is not much more than half as large as the former. Moreover, Mr. Yarrell's measurements for this bird's eggs are precisely the same as for those of the Blackbird, and not only not tallying with those of either of my eggs, but not even presenting a near approach to the medium dimensions. Great numbers of similar instances might be adduced, and 12 BRITISH lilKDS, TIIKIK EGGS AND NESTS. in connection with tlic very commonest birds. Even eggs irom tne same nest may continually be met with, presenting great disparity in bulK ; one in the number being frequently so small in comparison with the others as to set one invariably thinking it must have been the last laid, and that a partial failure ol egg-producing power in the mother-bird must be the explanatioa of the phenomenon. It seems scarcely open to question that the physical condition of the parent-bird must exercise a great influence over its eggproducing capacity. Its powers may be impaired by age, by the past effects of injury or sickness, by a partial failure of some necessary element of food, by undue pressure on the egg-producing organs, such as m'lst occur by the loss of one or more early layings. Indeed all these causes are well-known to interfere with the reproductive energies of animals at large, and it is a thorouglily ascertained fact that both the first and the last act most strongly in the case of many Birds. The comparative size of Bii'ds' eggs, therefore, seems to me a matter to which it is unnecessary, if not inexpedient, to direct the young collector's attention; in any other way at least, than as to a matter of curious observation and contrast. As a means of identification it fails completely, and is only adverted to here for the purpose ol obviating a portion of the perplexity which may often occur in practice to the youthful egg-fancier from the difference in size between different specimens of what are in reality eggs of the same species of birds, but seem to him, from their discrepaucj of dimensions, not possibly so. Again, the colour and markings of many different species of eggs are found to admit of great variation. The most familiar and striking instance is in the case of the Guillemot: but one more within the reach of every nest-hunter is presented by tiie I.N'TEODUCTORY CnAPTERS. 13 eggs of the Blackbird. Sometimes the spots on them are verj minute and multitudinous ; almost confluent from their number and minuteness ; sometimes large and well defined and permitting the ground-shade of the shell to be very apparent ; sometimes reddisli in colour, closely approaeliing the shade of those on the Ring-Ousel's egg, and sometimes brown in hue, with no reddish tinge at all ; and sometimes they disappear altogether, or very nearly, and leave the egg with a strong resemblance to the littlftspotted Thrush's egg.* To such an extent is this the case, that a year or two since I was misled into assuming that four eggs which I found in a nest with all the characters of a Blackbird's nest, must most certainly from their colour and markings, be assigned to a Thrush original and not to a Blackbird. Other familiar instances of the same kind may be noticed as met with in the eggs of the House-Sparrow, tlie Tree-Pipit, tlie Sky-Lark, the Yellow-Haramer, one or more of the Hawks, &c. In the fabric and materials of nests, again, as constructed by birds of tlie same species, much dissimilarity, under peculiar circumstances, will be found to prevail. But really not more than might have been looked for beforehand, if it were not that, in our asual way of thinking about birds and other animals, we lay so much stress upon Instinct, and do not so mucli as admit t>D our notice the possibility that many of their actions may be prompted by a measure of intelligcncp, and not simply an unconsidering, unreasoning influence, which we term their Instinctive endowment. No doubt Instinct teaches them both to buUd and how to build their nests, and what materials are the most suitable, and the sites that are most eligible. But it is scarcely Instinct which sets the Eagle and the Crow, wflen tneir abode ia in a place that does not furnish the sticks they commonly \\u2022 i'arrell, i. 201. Ilewitson, L C3. 14 BRITISH BIRDS, TKEIR EGGS AND NESTS, or instinctively use for building their nests, to adopt instead of sticks the sea-weed stems which their home does produce. And so too of the House-Sparrow, which builds a huge domed or well covered-in nest, if it selects a tree or ivy for its site, but only lines the bottom of the hole in thatch, or a wall, with abundant feathers or hair or straw. The Wren, again, which usually builds its nest so that it may easily be removed entii'e and compact, may be found to avail itself of such a site for its nest, that it may be built on the principle of application \\u2014 like the Martin's to the wall beneath the eaves \\u2014 so that, when taken from its site, it shall appear to have had a segment completely cut out or sliced oiT from it. The adaptation of materials to site also, so as to secure a greater degree of concealment by making the intrusive structure assimilate in external fabric and hue to tlie surrounding objects, is well worthy of noticing attention, as supplying not only fresh sources of seeming unlikeness in nests of the same species of birds, but also fresh instances of the little feathered architect's wonderful adaptive iuteUigeuce. The question, \\u2014 Why are Birds' Eggs, iu so many cases, so variously and beautifully ornamented? Why are their hues and markmgs made so attractive to look at ? has ofteu been asked, and two or tliree difi'ereut answers or modes of answer have been suggested. I have seen the idea started that the design of such various colouring and marking is intended to facilitate concealment, by the adaptation of the general hue of the egg to that of the recipient or supporting substances. The theoiy is at least original and amusing ; but unfortunately less happy than when applied to the plumage of the bu-ds themselves which lay the eggs. It is no easy thing to detect a Partridge as she sits, lifeless-seeming, amid other objects not more still than herself. INTRODUCTORY CUAFTERS. 15 and presenting no great contrast in colour to her feathers : but there is no difficulty in seeing her eggs as they lie in the nest. And so well aware is she of the fact, that she always covers her eggs with some convenient and suit able material \\u2014 last year's oak leaves, for example \\u2014 when leaving her nest deliberately, or not under the impulses of alarm. The Hedge-Sparrow's eggs again, or any other blue egg, how can they be supposed to become less conspicuous by their colour when reposing in some earth-brown or hay-coloured nest-cup ? If it had been said that the Golden Plover's eggs, the Peewit's, tne Snipe's, the Norfolk Plover's \\u2014 not to name many others of which the same might be alleged \\u2014 were of such general hue, so shaded and so marked as to be anything but conspicuous, as to be indeed well calculated to escape any but a most scrutinising notice, in the apologies for nests which usually contain them, the entire truth of the remark would have appealed to every nest-finder's experience and assent : but it will not do so in any other form. It is impossible to lay down any rule for the coloui-s of eggs in connection with the places, or nature of the places, in which they are laid. \\\"White eggs are not laid in nests buUt in dark holes as a rule \\u2014 indeed, very much the contrary ; witness the Dove's eggs, and so many of those of the Duck tribe; nor are dark-colom-cd eggs invariably found to be laid where exposed to the greatest amount of broad dayliglit. There seems to be no rule in the matter. Again, another answer to the question just noticed is, Eggs were made so beautiful, and so vatious in their beauty, to gratify and gladden man's eye. I don't dispute the fact that the beautiful shape, and the beautiful tints, and the beautiful markings do gratify and gladden the human ey< and human heart too. I 16 BlUTISII BIKD8, TIIEIK EGGS AND NESTS. kuou they do, and in thousands of cases, and with a great, pure pleasure. But that is a very different thing from saying tlial God made them so for no other reason, or even for that purpose as a principal reason. How many thousands of eggs, for ten that are seen by man, escape all human notice whatever ! How many millions upon millions in the old-world times before there were men to see them, must have had their fair colours, and delicate synmietry, and harmonious interminglmg of hues, for no purpose whatever according to this view ! No, no. Nature siiould not be read so. God made tJie Beasts of the Field, and the Birds of tlie Air, and the Fishes of the Sea, and the Insects, and the Shells, and the Trees, and Herbs, and Flowers, ail, as a rule, wonderfully, gloriously, harmoniously beautiful, because He is a God of order, and beauty, and harmony ; because it would liave been inconsistent with His own Being, with the necessary purposes of such a Being, with the declared objects of such a Being in Creation, TiOt to have made all \\\" very good ;\\\" and the same reason which accounts for the beauty of tlie myriad flowers \\\" born to blush unseen,\\\" for that of the imiumerable shells and insects of past days and the present day, for that of the glorious birds of Tropic lands, is all that we want in the way of explanation of the symmetry and beauty of the Bird's Egg \\u2014 God made it as well as all other things \\\" very good.\\\" Something more to the point for the practical egg-hunter, and even although he may be not very juvenile, is to recommend the practice of jotting do-s\\\\Ti notes of any peculiarity of either nest or eggs or behaviour of parent birds, in any supposable case a little unusual. Such notes are always interesting and very often useful at some long subsequent period; useful in themselves, and useful too as commenting on or else illustrated by, the sinular memoranda of other observers. Besides, what is put down upon IXTKODUCTOKY CHAPTERS. 17 paper while the incident is still fresh, and the memory of it not Interfered with by other and newer matters of strong interest, the record is sme to be accurate ; wlule mere recollection at a later date is about sure to be insufficient or untrustworthy. Perhaps the boy-collector too may not thuik a few sentences about blowing and drying and mounting his egg-treasures either tiresome or uunecessary. As a niJe, let the egg intended to be kept be blown and dried as soon as possible. There are several reasons for tliis piece of advice. The light shells travel more safely than the full ef;g;; the egg-shells do not suffer detriment from lying overlooked with their contents rotting within, as often happens with the collector of un-careful and un-precise habits ; they are put into a state of comparative readiness for prompt and complete preparation and arrangement ; and though last not least, a good, useful, methodical habit is eucouraged in the collector himself. There are several ways of blowing an egg and going tlirougb the preparatory stages of fitting it to take its place m a collection. There are also instruments for extracting the contents of the shell so as to obviate the necessity of makiug more than one hole. I don't think they are likely to be of much use to a mere boy. 1 am sure they would be a great deal of trouble, and I don't think that the end gained would repay the trouble and care expended, I have always found a small hole, only just large enough to admit the passage of sufficient air to expel the contents, made very carefully and neatly at the small end, and a larger one about half-way between the great end and the line of greatest diameter, which need not be more than a line in breadth for the very largest eggs (if not \\\"hard-sat,\\\") quite sufficient for my purpose, and not objectionable on the score of disfiguring the shell ; for by mounting the egg with the larger or vent hole, downwards \\u2014 the smaller hole being 18 bhitisu birds, tiieui eggs and nests. practically invisible in a great number of instances, at least until looked for \\u2014 it appears to be altogether entire and perfect. Any tolerably strong pin will da for the purpose with small eggs. For the larger and harder shells something more efficient win be required. A hard steel instrument fashioned like a \\\" glo \\u25a0 ver's needle\\\" \\u2014 that is with the penetrating end furnished with three edges all lost in the point \\u2014 is as good as any thing that could be devised, and by liaving two or three of different sizes, every case of necessity would bo provided for. The sharp-pointed pen-blade may be employed, but great care is necessary lest, when the perforation is just effected, the instrument slip a little further in than was intended, and an ugly fragment of shell be wrenched out. When the e^g is thoroughly blown, it is advisable to draw up a little clean water into it by the process of immersing tlie vent hole and sucking or drawing in the air from the shell with the mouth through the other\\u2014 just reversing the late process of \\\" blowing\\\" in sliort. The shell, when half-full, should be weh shaken, and the water then expelled as the legitimate contents had been : a very gentle puff will suffice for this. Hepeat the process two or three times, or until the water comes out as clear as it went in ; then dry the egg as weU as you can by blowing through it at intervals, after it has been so held that the moisture on the inside may all trickle down towards the vent-hole ; after which it may be set up for some hours in an airy, but not sunny, place to dry thoroughly. Some collectors varnish their eggs. A little of the white of the egg itself is all-sufficient, and that should not be applied unless the egg is perfectly clean, which is by no means the case with the eggs of many groundbuilding birds when taken from the nest. I have taken Dabchicks' eggs also so completely muddied all over, that it was IXTRCD'JCTOKY C HATTERS. I'J slmost impossible to get tliem clean. One, met with on one of (he Efesex marshes a year or two since, which was the only one yet laid and apparently not a day old, was so engrained with dirt or mud that it defied all efforts to restore it to its pristine whiteness. In tlie case of an originally white egg, such clTorts will not do much liarm ; in the case of an egg strongly mai-ke.d with deep colours, it is a different matter. The eflorts to remove the clay or dirt imparted by the feet of the parent bird may succeed in removing the stains in question, but mny also very likely remove some of the tmts or stronger colouring too. It must be rem.embered that the deeper colours of many eggs are not \\\" fast,\\\" at all events when they have not been long laid, and that attempts at cleansing, more vigorous than judicious, may easDy produce an undesired result. If the vent-hole is necessarily made large, there is no objection to placing a piece of thin or gauze paper, wetted with the varnish or white of the egg, so as to cover the entire orifice, and so exclude dust or other intrusive substances. As to mounting the eggs, and labelling for insertion in the collection, much depends on taste. An ordiimry \\\"printer's\\\" card is as good for the purpose as anything, and a little very strong gum-water is the only other requisite. A little attention to placmg the eggs symmetrically and neatly, and the use of a few gun- wads or halfpence or small wooden wedges, to retain the eggs, when accurately set in their true position, until the gum has had time to narden, are matters which will almost sm-ely suggest themselves to any youthful egg-fancier Avho is only tolerably given to admire the \\\"simplex mimditiis.\\\" As for labels, they may either be neatly written, or procured, at a very light cost, printed on pui-posa lor such application. BRITISH BIRDS THEIR EGGS AND NESTS. la the following pages I shall endeavour, as far as my subject will permit, to avoid mere dry aad uninteresting detail. It is, of course, quite inconsistent with the nature of tiie book to omit matter-of-fact descriptions altogether, or even in any very great degree; but an effort will be made to relieve the whole from wearing the appearance of a catalogue in disguise, and to give it as much of a life-like practical character as possible. How many incidents in a school-boy's life are connected, in his memory, with some nesting expedition, some recollection of, perhaps, an accidental discovery of a nest and eggs he had never seen before, or possibly wished and tried to find, but always wished and tried in vain. Such experiences are always pleasant and interesting in their detail to the real lover of birds and their belongings ; and often almost as much so when detailed by others as when reproduced in his own recollections of former days, and their Hopes, and plans, and successes, and disappointments, each often renewed, or often repeated under some rarying from. Why, then, should not such matters stand here and there in these pages? Our plan, therefore, will be to omit all special notice of the 22 BUITISII BIJLDS. TUEIR EGGS AND NhSTS. nests and eggs of so-called \\\"British BLi-ds,\\\" whose only claim to the designation lies in their having been met with once or twice or even some half-dozen times in the British Isles : to omit it, that is, in the body of the book, and to give such reference or description of at least the more interesting species and their eggs, as space may allow, in an Appendix. Accounts will be, however, given of the liabits of nidification and the eggs of all unquestionably British Birds, even although their breeding habitat be in another country, or most rarely and exceptionally within the compass of the British seas \\u2022 such birds, for instance, as the Fieldfare, the lledwing, the Snow-Bunting, and others, besides several of the Ancdidx. We begin, therefore, with our first Order, the \\u2014 RAPTOKES. FAMILY I.\\u2014 VULTUEID^. Two members of this Pamiiy, classed by some naturaUsts as belonging to the same genus, by others as species of two different genera, have been met with in Britain; but I believe one of them, the first-named below, only once, the other only twice or three times. They are only mentioned here as showing the justification there is for claiming the family of Vulturidx as being in anywise exemplified in birds belonging to the Britisb Isles. 1. GRIFFON VULTURE\\u2014 (r\\u00ab/^Kr/\\u00ab/r\\u00abi). 2. EGYPTIAN VULTURE\\u2014 (iVeo;5^ro\\u00ab percnopierus). FAMILY II.\\u2014 FALCONID.E. There are several species belongmg to tiiis Family of sufficiently common occurrence even still in these days of ganieprescrvcrs, ganie-kecpers, and vermin-killers. GOLDEN EAGLE. 23 Time was, and not so long since either, uhen many even of those most rare now, wore familiarly met with in almost all parts of the country; and Eagles and the Kite and several of the larger and more conspicuous Falcons and Hawks were not yet become so much like Black Swans, as they are now in so many English and even Scottish counties. Tliese birds diCfer, with a marked distinction, from those belonging to the Yulture-kind ; and as much in habits and food and power of whig as in appearance, formation, bill and claws, and other matters, such as the scientific naturalist notices for the purpose of enabling liimself and others to distinguish between Family and Family, genus and genus, species and species Thus, tlie Vulture's food is usually carrion ; the flesh of animals killed by other agency than their own, and in numberless instances in a state of putridity more or less complete. The food of tlie Falcon tribe generally consists of the flesh of creatures taken and killed by themselves. I say generally ; \\u2014 not invariably. The Eagles in a state of nature do not disdain to gorge themselves on the flesh of a dead sheep for instance, although they have had no hand \\u2014 or rather beak and claw \\u2014 in the death. StiU the rule is, and admitting not many exceptions when the whole family is considered, that the Falconidse hunt for, or surprise, and slay their prey for themselves. And very intent on this business are they oftentimes, when engaged in discussing the meal their craft or stiU vigilance, or fierce impetuous speed and dash has secured for them. Often, too, not a little sleepy and heavy are they after having been lucky enough to secure a large prey, and greedy enough to stuff themselves fuU with it. The bird which stands at the head of the family and alike deserves and does credit to his rank is the 24 IJKniSll lURDS, TIIEIU KbGS AM) NEMS. 3. GOLDEN EAGLE\\u2014 (Jfjmla ehrysaetos). It seems almost too tame to talk of an \\\" Eagle's nest,\\\" and we seem almost to feel as if different M'ords might well be applied to the nursery-structure of the King of Birds, and that of the tiny Tom-tit or the \\\"VYren. So, independently of the nice, simple, old meaning of the word eyry * which makes it so suitable as anrilied to the egg-liome of the grand kingly bii-ds, called Eagles, we feel a sort of satisfaction in limiting the use of the word eyry to the Eagle's nest alone. No easy matter is it always to cmtivate a visiting acquaintance with an Eagle. His home is not in a place easy of access to any but himself, or those, like himself, up-borne on wings. On rock platforms, not too scanty in size, in mountaLnous districts, and guarded by rugged, stern, precipitous rock-walls, utterly forbidding, in almost every case, access by human members from below, and not often to be safely reached from above, the great pile which forms the nest is usually built. Sometimes, but very rarely by comparison, it may be found on some large, possibly shattered, forest-trunk amid some wild, seldom-approached scene of loneliness or desolation. It is four to five feet in diameter, made of sticks of no mean size and length, sometimes lined with softer materials, sometimes not ; the new or more recently constructed nest placed upon those of last yeyr and other preceding years ; and would require a willing and able labourer to clear it thoroughly away, and no slight touch of the quality of the gate-bearing Jewish hero in the juvenile nestseeker who might aspire to carry off such a trophy of Jiis nesting \\u2022 Probably from Saxon Eghe (g soundod like y) an egg. The moder'n English form of tlie word would be \\\" Egirery \\\" tlierefore ; the old English form Eyry or Eyrie. Chauoei (about 1400) wrote ey for egg. GOLDEX EAGLE. 23 exploits. The site chosen for tlie nest-pile too is ahiiost inv;iri. ably one which commands a wide, unliindered look-out ; partly it is likely, under the influence of the strong instinct of vigilance in self-prcsorvation, partly also for the advantages offered by such a dwelling-place towards the detection of a distant prey. The number of eggs deposited is usually two, sometimes three. They are commonly of a dull whitish ground, mottled or marbled nearly or quite all over with a sort of rusty hue. The young ones, while yet too young to leave the nest, are amply catered for by their parents. Lists are sometimes given of the spoils, feathered and four-footed, found m what may be styled the Eagle's larder \\u2014 Black Game, Moor Game, Partridges, Hares, Rabbits, Lambs, young Roes, and so on, to an amount that would seem hardly credible to one not conversant with the Eagle's power of vision and mighty sweep of wing. Indeed there is a story told of a man in L-eland who got a fair provision for his family in a season of scarcity by no other effort than was requisite in plundering an Eagle's nest of the food brought in by the parent birds for their young. He is said also to have prolonged the season of supply by preventing the young ones from flying, by clipping their wings as the feathers grew. Instances have oeen known where the prey seized was human. Professor Wilson tells a touching story, in a touching way, of an incident of the kind, in which the infant was seized as it lay and slept where its mother had placed it, while herself busy not far off in the harvest field, and carried off by the strong bird to its eyry. Tlie poor mother, frantic with her loss, blind to everything but tiie thought and effort for the recovery of her babe, safely scaled the precipice, liigh up on which the nest was placed; though no man, however skilful and expert as a cragsman, h.ad ever dared altemct the ascent ; found her babe 2'> iSUlTISII BIRDS, TIIEIB EGGS AND NESTS. alive and unhurt and smiling in her face, descended again \\u2014 a iiore perilous feat stUl \\u2014 in safety, and ouce more on level ground at the foot, swooned helplessly away. The Eagles did not attack her in reality, though their fierce menaces made the spectators tremble. Our boy readers if ever they found an Eagle's nest might well need the protection of a good strong cudgel, fearlessly and skilfully wielded, before they succeeded in possessmg themselves of one of its eggs. \\u2014 Fi^. 1, plate I. 4. WHITE-TAILED EAGLE.\\u2014 (ZTa/we^a* albicilla). Cidled also Erne, Cinereous Eagle, Sea Eagle. \\u2014 This species \\u2014 a member of another genus, however \\u2014 like the last, breeds amid high, almost inaccessible rocks, in the mountainous solitudes of Scotland, and some of the northernmost British Islands. The nest resembles the Golden Eagle's, but is often more cushioned \\u2014 one can hardly say lined, when there is scarcely any cavity or depression to receive the eggs \\u2014 more cushioned with soft material such as heather or sea-weed. This Eagle seldom lays more than two eggs, which in ground-colour are Like the Golden Eagle's, but not often noticeably marked with red- The White-tailed Eagle is much more frequently seen south of the Border than the Golden Eagle. In fact, a year rarely passes without some record of the occurrence of this fine bu-d in more than one county of England, and those by no means always the most northerly. On the rabbit waiTcns of Norfolk and Suifolk they are frequently met with, and it not seldom happens that two are seen together \\u2014 perhaps the young from the same nest driven forth by their stern parents to seek then- ovra. living in the wide worla. The male Eagle of this species is kiiowc, like the male of many 97 otner kinds of birds, to take his turn with his mate in incubating their eggs. It ^ouJd seem difficult for the observer to be mistaken iu this fact ; for the male bii-d, as is the case in the other families of the Falconidse generally, is very distinctly smaller than the female \\u2014 to the actual extent indeed of not niucn less than one-third cf the entii'e size. 5. SPOTTED EA.GL'E\\u2014iJquila ncevia). Met with in Britain, once or twice only. We come next to a Raptorial Bird, whose food is proouied mainly from the water, \\u2014 namely, the G. OSPREY \\u2014 (Pandlon halixeius). The Osprey, or Fisliing Hawk, or Mullet Hawk, or Eagle Fisher, * builds its nest sometimes on a tree, sometimes on some part of an ancient and deserted building \\u2014 always on the liighest part, a turret or chimney for instance \\u2014 and sometimes on a rock or precipitous scar. But a very favourite and almost characteristic site \\u2014 speaking of the bird only as a British bird \\u2014 is oa some lone insular rock in a wild mountain loch in Scotland. I extract a very striking description from \\\" St. John's Tour in Sutherland : \\\" \\\" The nest was placed in a most curious situation. About a hundred and fifty yards from the shore, there rose from the deep water a solitary rock, about ten feet high, shaped like a broken sugar-loaf or truncated cone. On the summit of this was the nest, a pile of sticks of very great depth, evidently the accumulation of many breeding seasons, as the Osprey returns year after year to the same nest. How this heap of sticks witbutood the winter gales without being blown at once into the water puzzled me. * * * The female Osprey allowed our boat to approach within two hundred yards or so, and thee \\u2022 A translation of the Gaelic uarae of the bird. 28 BKJTlSIi lilKDS, TlIEIll EGGS AND XKSTS. leaving her nest, sailed upwards with a circling flight, till she joined her mate high above U3. Having reached the rock, and with some difficulty ascended to the nest, our disappointment may be imagined when we found it empty. From the old bird having remained on so long, we had made sure of finding eggs in it. Tlie nest itself, however, was interesting to me, perched as it was on the very summit o'f tlie rock, and composed of large sticks, * every one of which must have been a heavy burden for a bird of the size of the Osprey. In the centre of the pile of sticks was a cup-shaped hoUow, the size of a boy's cap, lined with moss and dead grass, and apparently quite ready to rect-ive eggs.\\\" \\\"In another nest,\\\" says the same author, elsewhere, \\\"we found two beautiful eggs, of a roundisn shape : the colour white, with numerc^us spots and marks of a fine rich red brown.\\\" \\u2014 Fig. 2, 'plate I. The Osprey is met with from time to time in almost all parts of the kingdom, but more especially along the east coast ; but it is known to breed nowhere in England now. In America, it is met with in considerable numbers, forming as it were a large colony, during the breeding season; of course, in the vicinity of some ample and convenient fishing station. We come next to the Falcons, distinguished from the rest of the Hawks, by, among otlier things, their long and pointed wings, and their vehement and lapid HigLt and dash in pursuing and seizing their quarry. Fu'st we notice the 7. GYR FALCON.\\u2014 (i^a/co Grmnlandicus). Also called Jer Falcon and Greenland Falcon. \\u2022 Some of the sticks \\u2014 or rather branches\\u2014 employed, are said to be \\\\\\\\ inch in diameter. PEREGRINE FALCON. 29 8. ICELAND FALCON.\\u2014 (/a/co Islandlcus). Neither of these birds breed in Britain, and they are only occasional and somewhat rare visitants. Whatever notice can be afforded to them, will be met with in the Appendix. 9. PEREGRINE FAI.CON. {Falco perejrinus). There was a tin)e at which this bird was abundant enough in our island. It still breeds in many parts of both England and Scotland, though much more commonly in the latter country. But in the feudal times there would have been no difficulty to the young egg-collector \\u2014 if such beings existed then \\u2014 in meeting with the nest of the Peregrine, in districts suitable to their breeding habits and requirements. Although some consideration, it is true, might have been advisable previously to appropriating the contents of the said nest for cabinet purposes. The right iiand of the fortunate collector would have been the penalty in lliose days of strict game laws. So stringent, indeed, were the provisions for preserving the Peregrine, that the customary breeding haunt of a pair was placed under the especial care of the occupiers of the land in the immediate vicinity, and they were made responsible, by the terms of their tenure, for the safe keeping of the noble birds and their offspring. One such site is in Goathlaud, on the line of the Pickering and Whitby Railway, and it is an interesting fact in the nesting habits of the Peregrine, that until within a recent period (and it is believed at the present time also), KiHuig-nab Scar has always been a site of that Falcon's nidification. Many of its breeding places, perhaps Uke others in the interior, known time out of mind by some name derived from the circumstance of their being thus appropriated, such as Faicon-scar, Hawk-scar, Eagle-cliff, are among the tallest and least accessible rocks of the sea coast. The nest itself is placed on rome projection, possibly within some fissure, and is so BRITISH BIRDS, THEIR EGGS AND NESTS. made of sticks, or seaweed from the coast, and is lined with soinft hail- on whicii, for the hoUow is not deep, the eggs repose. These are from two to four in number, often vary a good deal in size (probably according to the age of the laying bird), and not less in the markings and mottlings whicli pervade the entire sui'face. A reference to the engraving will give a better idea of the colour and appearance of this beautiful egg, than any description. Indeed, description of many \\u2014 of most \\u2014 eggs fails altogether iu conveying an adequate idea of what they are like. These birds were so much prized in the middle ages on account of their fitness for the highly-esteemed pursuit of Falconry; and their power of wing and magnificent flight are in themselves matters of great interest, quite independently of the excitement of the chase. The female, from her much greater size and strength, was emphatically \\\"the Falcon;\\\" the male, called the Tercel, or Tiercel, being more frequently flown at much smaller game, as Partridges. A Falcon-flight \\u2014 although the science is no longer ciiltivatcd at Didlington, in Norfolk, as it was a few years since by the late owner of the estate \\u2014 may still, however, be seen, from time to time, by the fortunately-placed observer, both Hawk and quarry being ferae naturd. Some luckless GuU, or Guillemot, or Rock-Dove, is selected by the strong freebooter and carried off from amid the passing multitudes with a fierce, rushing dash ; and if there are young to be sustained, the onset aad sweep may possibly be seen once and again. \\u2014 Fig. 3, plate I. 10. l\\\\O^V>X\\u2014{Falco subbuteo.)

A little hollow iu the ground, and that usually not too conspicuous by the absence of ling in its vicinity, with scarcely any lining, receives the eggs, three to five in number, and characterised by the reddish hue and spottings which seem to garnish the eggs of almost all the true Falcons. The nest is said to be sometimes built in a tree, and then, from l&r. Doubleday's account, seems to be made of sticks, and lined with wool.

Mice seem to form a favourite, if not staple, article of their food ; but they are cot exclusive in their diet. An occasional small bird, hosts of coleoptera or beetle-kind, cock-chafers in their season, grubs, and even worms, are known to be readily eaten by them. As intimated above, the species is everywhere familiar, and is alike too beautifid and too useful to be so wantonly killed as it too often is.- -Fiff. G, plaie I. 14. GOSHAWK\\u2014 (Jsiur palimbarius). We do not often see the Goshawk in any part of the kingdom, and very rarely indeed, except in some parts of Scotland and in Orkney. It, like the Peregrine, was in much request for the sport of Hawking : only, as its manner of flight was different from that of the Falcon, it was used for the pursuit of different species of game from the latter. Probably this really originated in the impulses of the Goshawk's own Instinct, which leads it to attack Hares and Rabbits, or birds which, like the Partridge and Grouse, never voluntarily fly at any great height above the level of the ground. One curious habit of this bii-d is that of waiting patiently imtil some bird, which it has driven to covert, leaves its shelter, when the pursuit \\u2014 after a pause of perhaps several hours \\u2014 is immediately resumed, and probably carried to its purposed result. Most of the other Hawks, when baffled in the way noticed, very speedily relinquish all apparent thought or recollection of the escaped creature, and proceed to seek for a fresh quarry. It builds its nest on some high tree; only the tree selected is never found in the inner and deep parts of the wood and forest. Like many other birds, both predatory and other, it will often return to the same nest, adding whatever rej'airs may be required, for several successive years. It lays three or four eggs, of a pale faint blue, quite untinged with any other colour. 3^ BRITISH BIRDS, THEIR EGGS AND NESTS. 15. STA'R'ROW-'RA.WK\\u2014CAccipaer Nisus.) Sometimes called Pigeon-Hawk. \\u2014 Another short-winged hawk, as the last named also was, but vastly more common and familiarly known. Some of the Falcons already named may be fitly called bold, or fearless ; the Sparrow-Hawk may be pronounced audacious, or impudent. If you hear some careful, Martha-like housewife of a hen skirling and fussing, in dire alarm, her terrified chicks, the -while^ seeking any possible shelter, you may DC almost certain that the gliding form you caught a glance of rounding the corner of the barn and making a rapid, but by no means noisy stoop, among the young poultry of various kinds in lively attendance on their mothers, \\u2014 you may be tolerably sure that the intruder was a Sparrow-Hawk, and that some hapless Dove or Chicken has lost the number of his mess. Not that he does not like wild game as well as tame poultry. Mr. Selby mentions one nest, containing five young ones, in or close to which were found a Peewit, two Blackbirds, a Thrush, and two Green-finches, aU fresh, and half plucked. The Sparrow-Hawk is believed seldom to give itself the trouble of building a nest for itself. Some old or deserted nest of the Crow or Magpie, particularly the former, and whether in a fork of the tree or liigh among its top, usually serves its turn ; and in this, very slightly repaired if at all, the mother bird lays four or five eggs, of a pale blueish white, abundantly and most variable blotched with dark red brown. In some few eggs tliis darker colour is more sparingly bestowed ; but they are not frequent, and, usually, the red is more or less confluent about some part of the egg \\u2014 either end or the middle \\u2014 more rarely dispersed in very distinct spots, \\u2014 Fig 7, plate I. 16. KITE \\u2014 (Milvus vulgaris) . Glead, Glade, Gled, Pork-tailed Kite or Glead, Puttock, Crotchet-tailed Puttock. COMMON BUZZARD. 35 One very rarely sees a Kite nowadays in our customary ield ramblings and observings; though, to be sure, some one did \\u25a0^\\\\T.-ite word not long since to the \\\" Zoologist,\\\" that he had seen one sailing overhead as he walked the streets of London. Perhaps any but rather resolute nest-hunters might say, if they knew the reception sometimes accorded by a Kite to a wouldbe plunderer of its nest, \\\"Well, the loss is not without its compensation.\\\" Eor the Kite fights fiercely for its eggs or young ; and has been known to inflict damage of both dress and person on a boy attempting to plunder its nest. It is a noblelooking bird; but not distinguished, as the Falcons are, for any very remarkable degree of boldness or courage. A fussy old hen has been known to frighten one from his purposed foray on her cliickens, and he used of old to be chased (for sport, of course) by a species of Palcon \\\" to the manner \\\" trained. The nest, usually found high-up in a high tree in thick wood or forest, is made of sticks and lined with any softer material found handy, and contains two or three eggs of a dii-ty white colour, with a few spots or blotchings of dull red. They cater liberally enough for their young ; no less than twenty-two Moles having been found in one nest. \\u2014 Fig. ], plate II. 17. SWALLOW-TAILED \\\"KlT^\\u2014CNauclerm furcatus).

I well remember as a schoolboy in Essex, some thirty odd years ago, that the nests of the Puttock, as the Buzzard was invariably called in that district, were more frequently found by us than those of any other wood-building Hawk ; and many a hatch of young Buttocks it fell to my lot to see brought within the old school-gates. Wliether the Buzzard is equally abundant there now 1 cannot tell. It seems to me that 86 BRITISH BIRDS, THEIR EGGS AND NESTS. not oiily Hawks, but very many of the smaller bii'ds as weli, we much less numerous now than in the days of my boyhood; and I have heard other nest-lovers make tlie same remark. In rocky countries the Buzzard sometimes builds her nest on precipices, or steep banks ; but generally, in our ovm country, some fork iu a tree supplies either the site for the intended nest, or possibly the nest itself; for, like several otlier of the Hawks already noticed, the Buzzard seems to think tliere is a deal of sound sense in the saying, \\\" Foolish birds build fine nests for wise Hawks to live in them,\\\" and acts accordingly. Tho eggs are from two to four in number, of considerable size, and some of them approaching veiy nearly in general look and colour to the Kite's egg. It just as frequently seems to wait until its prey comes to it, aa trouble itself to go far in search of it. It is rather a sluggard and a coward to have so much the air of a fineiooking bird about it. \\u2014 Fit/. 2, plaie IT. 19. ROUGH-LEGGED B^ZZARB\\u2014fBufeo lagopus).

This never was an abundant species in tliis country, and instances of its nesting with us are very rare. I well remember, however, when White's \\\" Natural History of Selborne \\\" first fell into my boyish hands, how his history of the lucky bii'd'snesting boy, who climbed the \\\" tall, slender Birch-tree,\\\" \\\" on the steep and dizzy situation, near the middle of Selborne Hanger,\\\" and brought down the only egg in the nest, and that \\\" hard set,\\\" impressed itself on my attention and memory. The nest was a shallow one, composed of sticks, and lined with dead leaves of the beech. The number of eggs \\u2014 an illustration of which is f )ven \\u2014 seldom, exceeds two. \\u2014 Fig. 3, lAaie II. ASH-COLOURED HAJIXIIER, 37 21. MARSH UAJmiER\\u2014fCircus mfus). Moor Buzzard, Bald Buzzard, Marsh Hawk, Harpy, Whiteaeaded Harpy, Puttock, Duck-Hawk. \\u2014 One would hardly expect to find tliat a bird, with such a string of aliases to its name, could enjoy a very wholesome reputation. However, he's no worse than his fellows of the Hawk family, and not so bad as some of them. Probably the name of Harrier, given to this and one or two of the Hawks next named, is derived from their method of beating or quartering the ground, when in search of prey, putting one in mind of tlie evolutions of the hound similarly engaged. Tlie Marsh Harrier or Moor Buzzard (or Bald Buzzard, as I used to hear it called in Essex) builds its nest of flags or rushes \\u2014 sometimes sticks or twigs \\u2014 on the ground, amid the grass at the bottom of a fui'ze or other bush ; occasionally low in the bush itself; and again, in a tuft of reeds or rushes sufficient to serve the purposes of concealment. In it it deposits three or four eggs, white, or with only a tinge of milk blue about them. It feeds itself and its young with young water-birds, if it can meet with them \\u2014 and. its name suggests the idea that young water-birds may be met with where itself is found \\u2014 or young rabbits or birds ; a few mice and small rats doubtless not coming in as altogether unworthy of notice to such hungry customers as four young \\\" Harpies.\\\" 21. HEN -HARRIER\\u2014 ra?rK5 cyaneus). t don't give a list of country or locai names here, as usual, because I wish to draw my reader's attention to the fact, that the different names applied to the same species of Hawk, are, in several cases, partly attributable to the differences in size, and especially in plumage, dependant on sex and age in the cases in question. This is quite the case with the Harriers generally, and puriicularly with the bird new under notice. There is a 38 BRITISH BIRDS, THEIR EGGS AND NE3T!\\u00bb. remarkable difference in colour between the male and female when adidt, and a likeness when the former is immature and the latter an old bird. Thus, the old male is mainly blue, the female brown ; so he is called the Blue Hawk often, or Dove Hawk, and she the Ringtail. Like those of the Marsh Harrier, the eggs of the Hen Harrier are white, and are placed in a nest of small sticks and long, coarse grasses, built upon the ground, four or five in number, and not often varying from the uniform tint of the ground-colour by the addition of a few reddishcoloured spots or speckles. Its distinctive English name \\u2014 ZTijw-Harrier, seems to be due to the fact, that, like the sick and repentant old Fox, it appears often to consider \\\" a chicken might suit me too,\\\" and acts accordingly. But, from its habits of regularly working over stubbles and other haunts of the Partridge and other like birds, there is little doubt that it varies its diet with a little game occasionally. 23. ASH-COLOURED IIXRRIER\\u2014 {Circus cineraceus). Tills bird, for which YarreU proposed the name Montagu's Harrier, is by no means of frequent occurrence in this country, and is scarcely likely to be met with by many of our young readers. The nest, like those of the other two species of Circus just named, is usually on the ground, often not far from gorse or whin-bushes; and the eggs, four or five in number, are like those of its congeners in general colour and aj)pearance. With this bird our list of Falcorudse closes. FAMILY II.~STEIGID^. When I was a boy I remember \\u2014 only those goings-back to school were a sad hindrance \\u2014 trying or helping to make a colleo tion not of Bi-ds' eggs exactly, but of Bird's \\u2022merry-thouojhta MEANS OF FLIGHT IN THE OWl.. '62 Did our young readers ever see such a collection, or think of it ? Perhaps the answer will be \\\" No ; \\u2014 and if we had, what would it have to do with a book about Bu-ds' eggs ? \\\" I will try and show that I have a purpose in mentioning Bii'ds' merrythoughts, and that it may have something to do with such a book a5 this, and its subject. We have already agreed that classification is a useful and necessary thing ; tliat nature herself leads us to it, and shows ua how to fashion and contrive it ; nay, that the very eggs of bii'ds are, speaking generally, such in their shape and mai-kings as often to suggest the formaiion of a group out of such and such different species producing them. But the merry-thoughts and the bones they are immediately connected with, the keel-like breast bone and the side and wing bones,* will be found to do the same tiling, with respect to the collection of three or four (or more) such groups of birds, as I have just called them, into what is termed a Family. Thus, if our readers could get the opportunity of looking at the merry-thoughts and breast-bone\\\" of half-a-dozen different Hawks, they would find, with a degree of variation according to the various species selected, a very obvious and striking correspondence or resembiance. The breast-bone, in every case, would show great depth of keel and strength of substance ; and the merry -thoughts would be seen to be firm and strong, and of great or considerable substance Next, if the corresponding bones of about the same umnber of birds of the Owl-kind {Sirigidos), were taken and compared with taose of the Falcon-kind just spoken about, while the mutual \\u25a0'esembiance of the Owl-kind bones was seen to be quite as great and obvious as in the case of the Hawks ; the difference between l.he said bones of the Owls and those of the Hawks would be 1 don't {rive the scientilic names of these bones, for obvious reasons. 40 lUUTlSIl BIRDS, THEIR EGGS AND NESTS altogether strange and lialf startling, from its greatness and fcddenness. The deep keel and the strong substance of the '.rcast-bone in the Hawk has given place to a shallow keel and weak walls in the Owl, while the curved, strong, broad, solid merry-thought has become a fork with thin, straight, weak, yielding shanks. So great and plain is the difference that any sharp intelligent boy could almost dii-ectly pick out for himself all the Hawk bones, and all the Owl bones, and put them in their several groups. And if he did, I think he would say to himself, and most likely to some other person, as soon as he met with one likely to be able to answer hmi, Wliat does this difference in these bones of these birds of different Families mean ? \\u2014 In plain words, it means difference in powers of flight. Any of our school-boy readers who wanted to prise his strong school-box open, because he nad lost his key, would not take his peu-knife for the purpose ; because he would think it foolish to use so weak an instrument for so strong an effort. A great strong cliissel would be much more likely to serve his purpose. And so is the work of God's hand. If a long, strong wing has to be moved rapidly, and even vehemently, the motion, like all animal motion, must be given by muscles. But the muscles must be fixed to wliat they are intended to move, or they cannot acton it; and they must be fixed at some other point also, or they would waste their power on nothing, instead of impartingmotion. And, of course, the stronger they are, the stronger must what they are fixed to be, and the larger also to admit of more and more strength. Well, the muscles that move the bird's wing are affixed at their other extremities to its breastbone and men-y-thought, and hence the size and strength of these bones in the Falcon kind with their vigorous, impetuous l%ht and sweep of wing; and the o iiUj-aruuve insigiiiricance and MEANS OF FLlbilT IN THE OWLS. 4.\\\\ wcakrioss of Uie same parts in the slow-flying, noiseless-winged Owlet. If our young friends are disposed (o udJ, in their collection of birds' eggs, ti^e so-called merry-l liought of each sepai'ate bird to the eggs laid by that bird, they will be apt to learn an interesting and instructive lesson in elementary anatomy. And such a collection may be made to a great exteu!,, without much trouble, by almost every one who has the ordinary facLHties of a residence in the country at his command. Having said so much to show how even the most simple and obvious and familiar dilTerences in the bone structure of birds suggests, or, if not, confirms the principle of classification of bii'ds, and therefore of their eggs, let us now go on to notice our quaint \\\"feathered friends,\\\" the Owls, and especially our more famihar acquaintance among them. There are other things belonging to the Owl family, which our sharp young friend just named would have just as little trouble in picking out from a heap of similar objects, as in the case of the bones. I mean the eggs. The same character, however much they vary in size \\u2014 and they do vary vastly in size \\u2014 is common to every one of the eggs. They are all white ; they are all very slightly oval, or very nearly round, and you cannot tell wh'ch is meant to be the big end, and which the little. Of course, this being the case, it would be of very little use to take up the small space available for illustration in this book, with representations of Owls' eggs ; and for the same reason, as little as possible will be said in the way of description. Any Owl's eggs which are likely to come under the notice of the school-boy nest-hunter wUl tell himagooddeal about their origin, bj their size and the place they are found in ; and the best picture ana description possible would not be able to teach him half as much. Just as the bones, noticed a page or two back, would be found to show that there was a sort of approach to something like a \\u00abS BRITISH BIRDS, THEIK EGGS AND NE5>TS. noticeable connection between the Harriers and the Owls, so the eggs of the former seem to hint at something of the same \\u00a3ind. The merry-thought and breast-bone of the Harriers are yastlj less strong and solid than those of the true Falcons ; and, so to speak, intermediate in such respects between these and those of tlie truest Owl, while the eggs are colourless or nearlj so, and so approach again to the Owl type. 24. EAGLE OWL\\u2014 {Bubo maximus.) This noble bird, the first on our list of British Owls, is sa occasionally and irregularly seen in Britain, that it can scarcely claim lengthened notice at our hands. 25. SCOPS EARED OWL.\\u2014 {Scops Aldrovattdi). Almost, or rather certainly, more rare than the preceding. 26. LONG-EARED OWL.\\u2014 {Otus vulgaris). Met with, though not very abundantly, in most parts of England. Its haunt during the day time is in ivy bushes, or other retreats affording security from the access of much light, its nest is most frequently an appropriated old nest of the Crow or Magpie ; perhaps even what was once the breeding-home of the Squirrel; and m it are laid four or five eggs IW inch long, by ] 2 ? iiich broad. It seeks its prey after sunset ; and as birds of various kinds are known to form part of its food, it seems almost certain that they must be taken as they sit at roost. What sad bug-a-boos Horned Owls must be made to offending j uveniles in little-bird nurseries. 27. SHORT-EARED OWL\\u2014 (Oto brachyotus). Woodcock Owl, Short-horned Howlet, Mousehawk, Hawk Owl. It breeds with us, but not very commonly, and many seem to come over in the autumn, and they are then frequently Been is a stubble, or otherwise roused by the sportsman. It*. BASN OWL, 43 nest is sometimes on the ground, and perhaps even in a rabbitburrow. The eggs are thi-ee in number, and scarcely differ the least in size from those of the bii-d last named. Young Grouse and other birds breeding about the moors are abundantly supplied by the parent Owls to their young when the nest chances to have been made in such a locality, and the old ones are very jealous of seeing their progeny too nearly approached, and expose themselves almost as fearlesaly on such occasions as either Partridge or Grouse. Tiieir local name of Ilawk-Owl is derived from the circumstance that they pursue their prey \\u2014 regularly \\\"hawking\\\" for it \\u2014 daring the daytime. 2S. EARN 0\\\\N'L\\u2014{Slj-lxJlammed). White Owl, Yellow Owl, Screech Owl, Gilly Howlet, Howlet, Madge Howlet, Church Owl, Hissing Owl. \\u2014 This common and useful bird breeds by preference in some building or part of one . a church tower, dove-cot, ruined mansion, or castle, and the Hke. My most familiar boy-acquaintance, however, was with the nesting place and habits of a pair which nested for many consecutive years in a slight hollow in the crown of a large pollard Elm tree in my father's church-yard in Essex. Thero were usually three or four young ones year by year, often with perceptible differences of growth among tliem. Indeed it is well kno\\\\Tn that this Owl and the last named, and probably others as well, lay their eggs in instalments, as it were, and when the first batch of two is about hatching or nearly so, other two are deposited in addition, and thus hatched in their turn almost as much by their brother and sister as by thfiir mother. Quainter, graver, odder, stranger, more irresistibly comic creatm-es than these young Owls I never saw; and the hissing and snormg, and peering looks at the spectator, and strange \\\"ntic contortions I heard and saw, bafHe all attempts 44 BRITISH BIKDS, THEIR \\u00a3GCiS AND iitSTS, at description. The eutcrtainment, for such it was most truly, usually begaa some little time before sunset, about which time the old bii'ds might be seen commencing thoir hibours of purveying food for Masters and Misses Howlet. At intervals of from seven to ten minutes one or other of them came to the nest with a prey, and I could always tell by the sounds and gestures of the young Owls when the old one was approaching. How they knew I could not tell ; it was not by sight, and I could hear no sound myself; but know they did most certainly. Mice, slugs, sometimes a large insect apparently, or a small bird, very rarely a Mole, or Eat of no large dimensions, were brought in continuous succession, and in the claw, not with the bUl. When the animal was of small dimensions, the old Owl flitted off again ivith scarcely any pause at the nest. It a large one, it seemed by the time which elapsed, and the sounds which became audible \\u2014 most vehement suorings and hissings \\u2014 that partition had to be made, and that the said partition was a matter ol the greatest interest to the parties concerned. I cannot affirm positively that the old Owls prosecuted then- most successful hunting all through the night ; but T believe they did, and I have seen them still at work in the morning long after sun-rise, once as lale as between eight and nine in the morning in the height of summer. As the inmates of a dove-cot, they are on very excellent terms with the proper dwellers therein, although from the known habits of other Owls the human ownens oi the dove-cot are apt to assume, most groundlessly and unjustly, th\\u00bb,t they are sure to destroy the yoimg Pigeons. I don't believe, however, that if all the rejected pellets of bones, fur, feathers, fee, from all the Barn Owls in the kingdom could be examined, tliat any trace of pigeon, old or young, would be discovered ; and that fanner is a foolish farmer who either destroys m Bam TAWNY QWL. 4s Owl himself or suffers any one else, whom he coT;ld prevent, to destroy one. They are perfectly harmless, exceedingly useful, and strangely interesting to the observer. I may add that since I began to write these lines, I am told that the self-same tree is still occupied by a pair of the self-same Owls, and has continued to be from the days of my boyish recollections \\u2014 a period of more than thirty yeais. The young of this and the next species are very bold, resolute little creatures, if taken when rather more than half-grown. They wiU throw themselves on their backs, and defend themselves pertinaciously with bill and claw against any foe, or supposed foe, human or other. The Barn Owl lias been known to take fish by plunging upon it in the water. The eggs are about li inch long, by 1| broad. 29. TAWNY 0'V^'L\\u2014{Si/rnium stridula). Brown Owl, Wood Owl, Hoot Owl, Ivy Owl, Jenny Howlet. This is the bird whose well-known and, as I think, musical note is so often heard at night in wooded countries, in the genuine \\\"tu-whit-to-who-o-o-o,\\\" or \\\"hoot.\\\" The last-named, or Barn Owl, is the Screech Owl proper, though not, in my experience, very much addicted to indulge in her unpleasant song. I very seldom used to hear a downright good screech in those old days. The Brown Owl makes its nest \\u2014 at least, lays its eggs \\u2014 in some lioUow tree, usually in a wood or near one. Some times a few feathers or a little moss may receive the eg^?,, often only the decayed wood. I have heard of the nest of this bird in other positions ; e.ff., in a deserted Crow's nest, or a hole in a rocky bank. But the hollow tree is the rule. The eggs are three or four in number, and larger than the Barn Owl's, being about lj\\u00a7 inch long, by 1| inch broad. The old birds nave two or three notes besides the hoot; one being a short, rather Bnarp cluck, often repeated. The young ones, after they fly 46 BRITISH BIRDS, THEIR EGGS AND NESTS. depend a good deal on their parents' exertions for food, which consists of young Rabbits, Hares, now and then birds of sorts.

I once saw a young Brown Owl, apparently waiting for its food to be brought, and sitting very still on the topmost bough of a tall tree, aimost knocked off his perch by the whizzing flight of a Wild Duck.

They spend only a part of the year with us, but that part involves the period of nesting. The nest is usually rather high up in a strong, thick bush, large-sized for the bird, cup-shaped, and made of coarse withered herbage externally, with rather finer materials within, and lined with hair or some such substance. The eggs are four or five in number, varying much in colour and marks. The ground-shade varies, and so do the markings ; the latter, however, being usually found thicker and darker in a zone or band encircling some part of the egg. Description is quite inadequate to convey any idea of these variations. The bird deserves its name, for it \\\" slaughters \\\" small birds, as well as other animals, and hangs up the carcases in regular shambles. It is wonderful how the frogs, beetles, caterpillars, cock-chafers, bii'ds, &c., which form its food, are fixed so very firmly and tenaciously upon the strong thorny point. \\u2014 Fiffs. 4, 5, plate II. 36.

The nest varies in material and struo 48 BRITISH BIRDS, THErR EGGS AND NESTS ture, almost as much as in its site. Moss, old and new, bents, straws, twigs, hairs, feathers, all are used. It is an amusing little bird, and pays many feeding visits to its young, as is the case with all insect-feeding birds. The eggs are four or Cwe in number, of dull white, tinged with blue, and spotted with faint red. It only visits us to breed here. \\u2014 Fi^.

Water-ouzel, Brook-ouzel, Water-crow, Water-piet, Bessyducker. \\u2014 I may as well own that I am a little bit \\\" fond \\\" about the Dipper. I dearly love to see him and hear liim in my rambles by our mountain becks. So lively, cheery, and jolly, even In the cold winter day, when the mere look of the chilly, shivering stream makes one feel goosc-skirmy. There he sits at the water edge, and sings like a Robin a little tipsy, and then in he tumbles, in a rollicking sort of way, as you become a little too niquisitive, and emerging a few yards further down, takes wing, and darts off v ith his Kingfisher-like flight. One nest some lads belonging to my family found here, was a feather-bed sort of structure of moss and a few feathers, filling up a six-inch square hole in the masom^y of a bridge in wliich one of the scaffold- MISSEL THRUSH. 49 rafters of the workmen had been inserted, there being a small, rouna nole left in the exposed side for exit and ingress. Others may be seen in cavities in a rock by the water-side ; and one 1 heard of, if my memory is correet, in Berwickshire, was built amid the stone-work of a water-lead for conducting the waste water away from a mill, and in sucii a position that the water in :ts fall projected itself beyond the nest, and formed a kind of arch above it. The old birds in going into or leaving their nest had actually to pass in either from the side or through the interstices of the small cascade. The eggs are five or six in number, and perfectly, purely white. A sad enemy to fish spawn 1 fear my little while-breasted friend is. I never yet carea to shoot one, I love them so well. But when there are half-a-dozen small but very hungry Dipper-mouths to be fed, I fear much consumption of fishes' food, as well as fishes' eggs, takes place. It is able to walk, though with much effort, under water, as weU as dive and swim ; and I have often seen them, on coming to the surface in a quiet pool, remain perfectly quiescent and floating for several seconds, \\u2014 Fig. S, j^late II. 40. MISSEL THUUSH\\u2014 (r\\u00ab/-t/\\u00abs viscivorus). Misseltoe Thrush, Missel-bird, Stormcock, Screech Thrush, Holm Thrush, Holm Screech. \\u2014 A handsome bu-d and an early builder. The Missel Thrash seems to lay aside some of its wildness in the breeding season, and draws near the dwellings of men. Its nest may continually be found in a garden or orchard close to a house, and in the thick fork of an apple or other fruit tree, often only a few feet from the ground. Woe be to the Cat who comes near the nest ! Such a storm of violent abuse and loud-tongued birds' Billingsgate as is poured on her devoted head ! Nor does the human intruder escape quite without a telling of it, or what my 60 BRITISH BIRDS, THEIR EGGS AND N\\u00a3ST\\u00bb. Yorksliire friends term \\\" a calling.\\\" If a Missel Thrush is very angry with you, be sure his nest is not far off. It is a larsjo structure, of much such materials and design as the Blackbird's, but often bound round and round with long rushes or roots, or other material sufficiently lengthy and pliable. The eggs, tour or five in general, often vary much in colouring and marks ; but are in general of a whitish ground-colour, lightly tinged with green (or perhaps faint red), and well spotted with red-brown. \\u2014 Fig. 9, Tplate II. 41.

Every body knows his persevering song, begun at day-dawn in early February, and persevered in for months of the spring and early summer. Every one knows its trim, neatly-plastered nest, with its warm, solid coating of grass and bents and roots and such like materials. And every body too, knows the four or five fair blue eggs with iheir tidy black spots, which now and then, however, can hardly be seen at all. Every body also knows how fussy the old mother BLACRBILD. 51 Thrush is the day her brood quit their nest ; and how, if you catch one of her luvkward, ill-ilying, soon-tired squad of young ones, she will follow you with much objurgation and no little plaintive entreaty that \\\"a great fellow like you, who ought to be ashamed of yourself for frightening a poor little fluttering creatur-e like that, will put it down again soon, and not hurt it, and be a dear, good man, \\u2014 now do, won't you ! \\\" \\u2014 Fig. 10, plate II. * 42.

A:id to a very youthful nest-hunter what a deserving bird the Blackbird is. Making his nest usually in such places and so that detection is not at all a matter of course, and yet not altogether beyond the discenmient of inexperienced eyes. The discovery of our first Blackbkd's nest is always felt to be a sort of achievement, aud one to be spoken of with ixasonable seK- approbation too. Li the hedge, at the bottom of the hedge, on the stump, behind the stump, below the stump, an exciesence on the side of the ragged old tree, in a wall tree, in an evergreen or other thick bush \\u2014 how often have we found the nest ic these and such like places. Once we found one which we sel donm as made by the untidiest Blackbird that ever lived. It was Li a thorn hedge thick and high, and a great rough structure. But a lock of wool, a big one, had been unmanageable and had E 2 53 BKlTISll BIRDS, TUEIR EGGS AND NEStfl. caught on the thonis, and the feathered architect couIJ do nothing with it, and there it hung out of the ncst-wali a thick tangle, inches long, and making the nest as conspicuous as it a flag had been stuck just above it.

His wild and not unmusical note, though it might sound harsh in a trim garden in Kent or Essex, and to an ear not attuned to moorland sounds, is always as welcome to me as the gentler twitter of the Swallow. I like to hear his attempts at song, reminding the listener of the Missel-bird's early spring music. kxA I like to hear his wilder, grating call-note, which is the usual warning the ornithologist has that the Moor Blackbird has returned for the season. His nest is very like the Blackbird's in design and general structure. An inner lining of bents and fine ling, a wall of clay, and an outer husk of moss, ling, and such like moorland matters. It is not strongly or compactly formed, and makes a great litter if kept a day or two and subject to be handled or moved, however carefully. It is always built on, or near the ground, on the wild moor ; and I once trod the feathers out of the wing of a sitting hen, oa whom and her nest 1 nearly trod in leaping a guUy. The eggs are usually four or five in number, and remind you of the Blackbird's eggs in I heir general appearance; but the blotchings or markings are redder, and often much larger or more pronounced than in the K(;IUN. 53 case of llie Blackbird. Their eggs, too, vary generally in size, even in the same nest. Out of the contents of two nests I had brought to me a year or two since, no two seemed to agree exactly in dimensions. \\u2014 Fig. 12, flute II, 45.

It was Hedge-Sparrow in my childhood and youth, and Hedgesparrow to me it will be called to the end of the chapter. I coidd no more wantonly kill a Iledge-Sparrow, in my sparrowkilling days, than a Robin ; and now, wlien I liear his low, sweet pipe, and see his wings quivered as he hops on the ground or from spray to spray not knowing I am noticing him, he seems as dear to me as ever. The mossy nest, with its intermixture of fino roots and hairs, may be found weeks before leaves are thought of, on the bank-side or low in the hedge, and little concealed ; and the four or five \\\"beautiful blue eggs in it become familiar to every nest-seeker among his very earliest acquisitions. \\u2014 Fig. 13,plaie!T, 48.

It seems to be, or to liave been, a common reeling among boys, and is embodied in the old lines : \\u2014 \\\" The Robin and the Wren Are God's Cock and Hen.\\\" ITow beautiful the Robin's eggs are when just laid ; and how they lose their peculiar pinky loveliness from being blown. A hundred different places, too, the little bird selects for the site of its nest ; often being such, moreover, as to illustrate their confiding fearlessness, as much as the result in them of the pressure of winter cold and hunger. In the tilt ot a wagon ; in a steam-boat ; in a room of the cottage ; near a blacksmith's forge ; in the constantlyused garden-shed, as well as in the ivy or evergreen bush ; or on the bank, or in the hedge ; or in a hole in the old ruin or bank or house-wall : all places seem to suit it alike. The eggs are five or six, sometimes seven; and the shell is wliite, more or less freckled with light red. \\u2014 Fig, 14, plate II. 49. BLUE-THROATED WARBLER\\u2014 (P//^\\u00ab/cKm Suecica).

Eiretail, Fireflirt, BrantaU, Redtail. \\u2014 The male is one of the most beautiful of cm- small birds, and I wish I could think it as abundant with us as it used to be. The nest is loosely constructed of moss, with a few small straws or bents sometimes, and hair and feathers inside, and almost invariably is placed iu a hole, it may be in a hollowish tree, or a wall, or even in a bank ; and here, where dry-stone walls abound, its choice of nestingplaces is inexhaustible. Very watchful are the old birds over the eggs, and very fussy and noisy when the eggs have yielded their living contents, and yet very careful too. I knew there was a nest the vear before last not far from my garden gate ; but it was WUIN-CUAT. 55 not till I hid myself most carefully and patiently beliind the door, that I made myself master of the vigilant little sentinel's secret. It lays four or five, and, occasionally, six eggs, of a pale uniform blue colour, perhaps tinged with a faint green shade. They ire almost as pretty as the Hedge-Sparrow's. \\u2014 Fig. 15, plate II. 51. BLACK REDSTART\\u2014 (P/5^\\u00ab?VKra Tithys).

Sione-cliatter, Stone-clink, Stone-smick, Stone-chack, Stonesmith, Moor-titling, Chick stone, Black-cap. \\u2014 A very rommon bb:d m many districts, and from his habits much more familiarly and commonly known and noticed than other birds equally or even more abundant, but of less obtrusive, or quieter habits. Flitting about from bush to bush, and seating himselfpertly on the top spray, there he sits and \\\" cliats \\\" or \\\" clinks \\\" till the passenger comes too near, and then off he flies again, to perch again a few yards fiu'ther and repeat the same performance. The nest, sometimes very neat and well-constructed, of moss and benty grass, and lined with hair, feathers, fine grass-stalks, &c., is often quite on the groimd and with no bush near ; sometimes at the foot of a low bush, or in the bush itself, but very near the ground. The eggs are five or six, of a pale blue ground, very sparingly freckled with dull reddish brown, and chiefly near the large end. The nest is often hard to find, and especiaDy when built among longish herbage, or in or near a whin-bush. \\u2014 Fig. 16, plate II. 53. WHIN-CHAT.\\u2014 (^^orjVo^a ruhctra). Grass-cnat, Eurze-chat. \\u2014 Many of the bnds last-named pass the whiter in England ; but only a few of the Whin-chats. This is never so abundant a species as the last, and though with some 50 BRITISH BIRDS, TIIKIR EGGS AND N' tSTs, Bimilar habits it has no urgent inclination to force us to notice it by the incessant repetition of its note. The nest strongly resembles that of the Stone-chat. It is also usually placed on the ground, and is folly as hard to find as that bird's. The eggs, five or six of them, are of a uniform blueish green, very slightly speckled or marked with dull-red. \\u2014 Fig, 17, plate II. 54. WHEAT-EAR\\u2014 (5'\\u00ab.nco/a cenanthe). Eallow-chat, \\\"VVhite-rump, \\\"V\\\\Tiite-tail, Eallow-smick, Fallowfinch, Chacker, Chackbird, Clodhopper, with some other quainter names still, which I have noted down, and yet another or two common to the Wlieat-ear and Stone-chat, such as Stone-ohacker. A common bird enough liere, and with some of the more obvious habits of the Stone-chat. It perches on the stone walls as one approaches it, and flirts its tail and chacks, and then diving below the wall on the far side, re-appears again ten or twelve yards lower, and acts as before ; and so on for a hundred yards or more. The stone walls in our district and the large heaps of stones, removed in reclaiming parts of the moor and flung promiscuously together any where to be out of tlie way, afford them capital breeding places. In other countries old walls, or holes in the sides of pits or excavations, serve their purpose. The nest is not very artistic or well-finished, and formed of many different materials \\u2014 bents, feathers, dry roots, fur, in short any waste matters which may have come in the way of the builders. The Eggs are five or six in number, and of a pale-blue colour not so dark as tliose of the Hedge-Sparrow. It is said that ])eople accustomed to the habits of the Wheat-eai- are al)lc to find its nest without dilBcidty, from the occurrence r.f certain noticeable sicrr-s ii: its neighbourhood. \\u2014 Vlrj. ], jilale III. REED WAKULKK. 57 55. GllASSHOPPER WARBLER\\u2014 (Salicana locusteUa). A summer visitor, of shy and retired habits, and very vigilant. Its note, very shrill and constantly repeated, reminding one of tlie Crieket or Grassliopper's note, gains it its name. The nest is liard to find, and unless the bird be very closely watched, it may baffle a good observer. It is placed in spots matted and overhung with growtli of grass or other herbage and bushes ; is cup-shaped, made of coarse dry grass, wiLli finer within ; and contains sometimes as many as seven eggs, of a pale pinky-white colour, freckled witli spots of a darker shade of red.\\u2014 ^;V7. 2, plate III. 56.

Many a lad, too, knows that by shying a stone in near its haunt, its notes may be elicited almost any hour in the night or day. I think I have neard it singing on all through the night, and notwithstanding the absence of any pretence at dayUght. Its nest is usually placed near the ground, in the vicinity of more or less water, and is supported, as well as concealed, by the coarse lierbage. Made of coarse grass stalks externally, and lined witli finer ones and hair, sometimes with a foundation of moss, five or SIX eggs are deposited in its cup-shaped lioUow, of a pale brown colour, a little mottled witli darker brown. \\u2014 Fig. 3, plate III. 57.

Almost as zealous a songster as the Sedge Warbler. There are few hours in the twenty-four 55 BKITISII BIRDS, THEIR EGGS AND NESTS. when its voice may not be heard about its accustomed haunts ; namely, willow and reed beds, and particularly the latter. The nest is, perhaps, the deepest made by any English bu-d,'and quite a long inverted none in shape. It is affixed lo, or rathei built so as to include turee or four reeds, or more. So that, however the wind blows, it is quite fast, wliile its great depth prevents the eggs falling out, even if the reeds be blown almost level. The bird has been seen still sitting when the violent gusts forced the nest down almost to the water level. The nest is made of long grass and the seed-stalks of the reed, and lined with wool or the like. Four or five eggs of a greenish-wliite Dolour, marked in spots and dashes of green and pale brown, are usually laid. \\u2014 yirj. 4, plate III. 59. NIGHTINGALE.\\u2014 (P/ii7oOTe/a iKscitiia). This sweetest of the English warblers has but a limited range [n Essex, Suffolk and Cambridgeshire, I used to hear it abundantly ; but of late years, as a resident in Yorkshire, its note iias become strange in my cars. Shy and vigilant in its habits, it does not willingly expose itself to observation, and its haunts are so thick that discovery of its nest is not always easy. It seems often an untidy structui'c, but according to my observation, not usually built on the ground, as Mr. Yarrcll states. I have found it in a thick thorn hedge or bush, and in slu'ubs in the tjarden; made of twigs, straw, grass, and especially old oak leaves, and with only a jagged margm. The eggs, four aud sometimes five of them, are of \\\" an uniform olive-brown colour,\\\" and from the time they are laid, the bird only sings occasionalij. Alter they are hatched, never. \\u2014 Fi^. 5, plaie III. GO. BLACKCAP. \\u2014 {Curruca atricapilla). Blackcap ^Vai-bler. \\u2014 This bird, with several others, has a local GARDKN WAKBLER. 59 or country hame in common, derivable, I believe, from the structure of the nest. I mean Hay-jack or Ilay-chat; but it is I think, much less frequently distinguished by that name than the three birds next to be mentioned. The country-boy's name for one of these must always be distrusted, as is the case also with Ids designation of other common, but much more dissimilar birds. Thus, not to mention other instances, the Blackcap proper, the Greater Tom-tit and the Stone-chat are all called Blackcap. \\u2014 The Blackcap Warbler comes to us in spring and builds in our gardens and shrubberies as frequently as ia wilder resorts, but always in places where there is thick foliage and plentiful means of concealment. It is a very shy bird and very unwilling to be gazed at. If it sees you watching it, you soon lose sight of it as it hops and twists from spray to spray into the inner and shadiest recesses of its haunt. Its nest, too, is studiously concealed, and Mr. Yarrell says it will leave two or three just-commenced nests in succession, on light grounds of suspicion that it has been noticed in its labours. The nest is a benty, and saving for the ties of wool or cobweb, a slightly compacted edifice, lined with hair and fine fibres, and contains four or five eggs of varying colour and mottlings \\u2014 white, greenish or tinged with a peculiar shade of faint red, being the groundcoloui-, with markings of a reddish brown. \\u2014 Fig. 0, plale III.

Nettle-crcepcr. \\u2014 Another pleasant singer, but with occasional harsher notes, and a chiding one, not unlike the Sedgebird's, when uneasy or irritated. This is the usual Haychat of the country lads, and fully as often called the Nettle-creeper; the former name being due to the fabric of its nest, the latter to its habits of twining in and out of the leaves and coarse herbage which abound among its haunts. Little description of the nest is needed, except that it seems slighter, and is thinner at the sides than those last named, but still it is not less compact. The eggs vary a good deal in appearance, but there is still such a family likeness among them that they are easily recognizable by most eggfanciers. Green, in different shades, is the predominating colour. \\u2014Fij. 8, plate III. C3. LESSER MllYYE-1BR0kT\\u2014{Cunuca syhiella).

It is abundant enough in some well-wooded parts of the kingdom, and its song is only called such by courtesy. It builds a domed nest ; that is one covered in above, and with a side entrance ; on the ground amid grass or weeds. It is made of grass, dead leaves, moss, and lined with hair and soft grass.

It sings \\\" a soft and pleasuig \\\" song, and is a lively little fellow, in incessant motion. Very restless and uneasy too, when you are near its nest, and particularly if the young are hatched. The nest is domed, externally like the one last named, but always lined with feathers, wliich the last never is. It is built on a bank or bankside, among grass or other herbage, and contains five to seven eggs, white, with many small speckles of red not very dark. There is an instance on record, in which this bird did not leave its nest tliough it had been bodily removed from its site on the ground, and even before any eggs were laid or the nest itself completed \\u2014 one of the most remarkable cases of the kmd known. \\u2014 Fig. 11, plate III. 66. CHirrCHAPE\\u2014 (5y/wa hippolais). Lesser Pettychaps, Least Willow Wren. \\u2014 An \\\"early bird\\\" this is in coming to us in spring time, and able and willing enough to take its substitute for the \\\" worm.\\\" The two syllables of its name, differently accented, form its song. Its nest is like that of the ^Villow Wren, with the addition of a few dead leaves outside 62 BRITISH BIRDS, TIIEIK EGGS AND NESTS. and abundance of featliers inside, and is also placed on (or very near) the ground on a hedgebank. Tlie CbiiTcliaff lays six eggs, white, with specks of dark purplish-red. \\u2014 Fig. 12, plate III. 67. DARTFORD ^K^^ljY^^\\u2014iMelizophilusprovindaUs). A bird wliich is scarcely known except on some of the furze, growing commons of the South, especially Kent and Surrey The nest is of dry grass-stalks, loosely put together and tied with wool, and sparingly lined with other fine and dry vegetable substances. \\\" The eggs,\\\" we read in Yarrell, \\\" are somewhat similar to those of the Wliitetliroat, but rather less ; and Hke tliem, are tinged with green. They are speckled all over with olive-brown and cinereous on a greenish white groiond; the markings becoming more dense and forming a zone at the large end.\\\"\\u2014 J?y. 13, plate TIL 68. GOLD-CRESTED REGULUS\\u2014 (i?^^\\u00ab&5 crhtatm). Gold-crest, Gold-crested Wren, Golden-crested Warbler, Goldcrowned Kinglet. \\u2014 One of the smallest of our native birds and possessing a \\\" soft and pleasing song.\\\" Its nest \\u2014 one of the very most beautiful of all our English nests \\u2014 is built below the branch of a spruce fir-tree and near the end of the bough, being suspended to two or more of the spreading side-boughs. These are often woven in with the moss and wool of the nest, and then tliere is a Uuing of feathers; spiders' webs too are used to compact the structure. Seven or eight eggs are laid, which vary remarkably, in d. ffcrent nests, in both ground-shade and markings. Some remind one of the usual Robin's egg in both, though the spots are much finer. Others are pale white, with yellowishbrown (rather than red) speckles, \\u2014 Fig. 14, plate III. BLUE TITMOUSR. 63 69. FIRE-CRESTED 'KEGULUS\\u2014CRec/ulus iffmcapiUus). Much less common than the last, though very likely often confounded with it from its great general resemblance. Its nest is like its gold-crowned relation's, and the eggs seem to resemble the variety first described in the above notice of that bird. V. PARID^. 70. GREAT TITMOUSE.\\u2014 rPara* major). Great Tit, Oxeye, Blackcap, Great Blackheaded Tomtit, Pickcheese. \\u2014 It might also be called, and I believe is in one district, ths Saw-sharpener, for its note certainly puts one in mind of tha\\u00bb; agreeable musical operation. The Tomtits are familiar to all of us, and \\\"impudent\\\" is one of the epithets we most usually apply to the whole tribe. Most of them breed in some hollow place or hole. The nest of the Great Tit is formed of moss, with a feather lining, and is sometimes placed in a hole in a wall ; sometimes in some appropriate recess in a hollow tree. Like the other Tits, it lays many eggs, occasionally from six to nine. They are white, of fair size, and well spotted as well as speckled with a decided shade of red. There is an easHy recognised resemblance between the eggs of all the Tomtit family. \\u2014 Fig. 15, plate III. 71. BLUE TITMOUSE\\u2014 (^Par?;5 caruleus). Tomtit, Blue Tomtit, Nun, Blue-cap, Blue-bonnet, BiUy-biter, Hickwall, Blue Mope. \\u2014 One of the most impudent of an impudent lot. A pair had biult their nest in a crevice between the lintel and stonework of my coacli-house, and my children from their nursery window observed it. Eor their amusement I got a ladder and looked in. The bold little matron could not be induced to leave the hole, but spit and hissed like a regulai 64 BRITISH niivus, their eggs and nests. vixen, and tried to make herself as big -as two by ruflling up het featlicrs, so as to friglitcn the owners of tlic ugly faces, as she would tliiuk, she saw at her door. Often, too, have I been bitten sharply by one I had laid hold of. Almost any hole in any object will do for the nest-site. Even a bottle, a wooden box, a pump-barrel, a quccr-sliaped cavity in an old tree only big enough to admit such a small creature, all are made available. The nest is voluminous, of moss, hair, and feathers ; and the eggs are abnosl endless. From six up to twelve or thirteen is of common occur rence. Llr. Ilewitson mentions one case of eighteen eggs 1 They are white, and spotted with pale red. The jouiTicys of the old birds to and from the nest when supplying their large family with food are literally innumerable ; and the number of small catcr])Lllars, grubs, plant-lice, and the like, destroyed by these jidefatigable caterers, must be simply astonishing. I think the pair just now referred to made at least one visit to the nest every two minutes throughout the day. The climbing, clinging habits of this and other Tomtits are very amusing; and in former days I made them dance on the slack-rope for my amusement and my friends'. 1 strung a nut or two on a piece of strong thread, and tied the two extremities to a tree and a nail in a wall near the window, respectively. This plan gave me many lengthened opportunities for watching their ways. I have also seen them stripping off the loose bark from pine-planks and picking out the fine fat grubs which eat their way between the wood and the bark. \\u2014 Eig. IG, flate III. 72.

Incessantly active and frequently associating with other small bii'ds it prosecutes a restless search for the small insects and seeds which form its food. Ita nest, of moss and wool and hair, is placed in a hole in a tree, sometimes very near the ground ; sometimes even in a hole in the ground which has been made by some small quadi-uped. Like the other Tits, if necessary it wiU enlarge a hole in. a tree which it finds already such as nearly to suit its requirements. Sis to eight eggs are laid, white, and spotted with faint red. 74. l^IARSII TITMOUSE.\\u2014 (Ptfr/^? pduslris). Coal-head, Black-cap, \\\"Willow-biter. \\u2014 A plentiful species in places ; but as its name intimates, with a preference for districts with the peculiar low growth of bush and willow found in low fenny countries. It makes its nest in old willows and the low stunted trunks of pollard trees, and will labour hard to make a nearly suitable hole quite serviceable. It is said to carry the chips it makes quite away to some distance. The nest is better built than those of the Tits hitherto named, of moss and wool ; and the number of eggs varies from live or six to eight or even ten. They are of the usual Tom-tit type, white, spotted with red. 75. LONG-TAILED TITMOUSE.\\u2014 (Paras candatus.) Lcng-tailed Mag, Mum-ruffin, Bottle-tit, Bottle-tom, Longtailed Capon, Long-tail Pie, Caper Long-tail, Oven-buUder, Poke-pudding, Mulllin, &c., &c. \\u2014 The beautiful, even wonderful nest of this little bird must be well-known to almost all nestfanciers\\u2014 oval, of great size compared with the tuiy architect; built, too, entirely by the female, wondrously compacted with moss and wool, and \\\"sparkUng with lichens\\\" affixed to the outside, it affords access by one hole only, on the upper part of one side, to the inside most warmly lined with feathers. So 6(5 ~ BllITISH BIRDS, TITXni EGGS AND NESTS. thoroughly is it secured to the sticks which support it, that it is scarcely possible to obtain an entire one without cutting i.lie sticks for removal also. The eggs are often ten in number, and sometimes one or two more, wTiite, and very slightly specked with red, if at all. Wliat the little bird does with her long taD when sitting, is a marvel. The young, when able to fly, kecf. much together and with their parents ; and often, when at rest, sit very close together on one branch, so as to present a doubtfullooking feathery lump to the observer's eye. \\u2014 Fig. 17, plate III. 76. BEARDED TITMOUSE.\\u2014 (Par\\u00ab5 biarmicus). The male of this species ia, indeed, a beautiful bird. They ar& met with in sufficient abundance in many districts in England, e.g., about the Norfolk Broads, the Meres in adjacent counties, as well as in Surrey and Middlesex. Until lately, from the fenny nature of the soil of their habitat, they have been less observed than any other birds ; but now their habits are much better known. Their nest is often made of various finer sedges and the dead flag-like leaves of the reed with a little grass, and lined with the seed-down of the reed. Sometimes almost on theground, sometimes raised a little above it in a tuft of grass or reeds, on the margin of a ditch or other water, it contains four to six eggs, not so large as those of the Greater Titmouse, and of usual Titmouse colour and markings. \\u2014 Fig. 1 S, plate III.

GREY-HEADED AVAGTAIL. 67 VII. MOTAClLLIDJi:. 78. PIED WAGTAIL.\\u2014 (Ifo/anV/fl alba). TVliite Wagtail, Black and TVliite Wagtail, Dishwasher, Washtail, Nanny Washtail. \\u2014 I think we, aU of us, know this familiar and very graceful bird, and like to see its active run and short flight taken for the purpose of captm-ing an insect. We have often been amused, too, at seeing perhaps a wJiole family of young ones running among the legs of the cows near the water, and taking a fly now from the belly or flank of the great animal, and then from its leg or the ground. The nest is made of grass, bents, dead roots, moss, and is sometimes found in a hole in the rude wall of an old shed or the side of a haulm wall or pile of furze, or in a hole in a bank ; sometimes on the outside of a heap of sticks, or in thatch, or upon the end of a haystack, and other analogous places. Four or five eggs are customarily found in it, white, and speckled with cinereous spots and lines, being often such as to resemble one variety of the varying eggs of the House- Sparrow. \\u2014 Fig. 19, plate III. 79. GEEY WAGTAIL.\\u2014 (i\\u00a5o/ac///\\u00ab boarula). Less plentiful than the Pied Wagtail, equally elegant and more beautiful, this little bird resembles the other in its ways and habits. Its nest is placed on the ground at no great distance from water, which has many attractions for it, as well as for the common \\\" Naimy Washtail.\\\" The materials and general structure are, in the main, the same as in the last case ; feathers and wool being introduced as a lining. There are often five or six eggs in it, of a faint white ground-colour, mottled and jtreaked with very light brown, a few streaks being sometimes of a darker tint. \\u2014 Fig. 20, plate III. SO.

It buUds on the ground, in cornfields or fallows ; sometimes on a stump of a tree level with the grouud, or on a bank of earth overhanging water, or in a hole in a wall in the same vieinity. The said nest is made of moss, roots, dry grass, and lined with the same, only finer, and a little hair. Four to six eggs are laid, which Mr. Yarrell says, \\\" are not un like those of the Sedge-Warbler, only rather larger ; whitish in colour, mottled nearly all over with yellow-brown and ashbrown.\\\" VIII.\\u2014 ANTIIIDiE. 82. TREE PIPIT.\\u2014 (^\\u00ab;/i\\u00ab5 arboreus). Pipit Lark, Pield Titling, Field Lark, Tree Lark, Grasshopper Lark. \\u2014 No long time elapses after the spring arrival of the Tree Pipit before he makes his presence observable by indulging in his peculiar mode of recommending his song, not unpleasant in itself, to our notice. Seated on the topmost twig of a tree or high busli he sings awhile, and then up he goes with fluttering wing, singing all the while, and also while descending from his greatest height on outstretched wing to the twig he started from. The nest is always on the ground, and not far from a hedge, or under a low bush, and is found also in woods or nurseries not far from the edge of a drive or glade. It is made of moss and fibres and grass, Ihied with finer grass and a little fiair. The eggs vary inconceivably in tint and marks, and entirely baflle description. Some are purple-red, others yellowishwhite in ground, clouded and spotted almost all over with different shades of Ki^Gyish brown. \\u2014 Fiij. 22, 23, plaie III. KOCK npii. 69 83. MEADOW VIVlT.\\u2014iJnihus praiensis). Titlark, Pipit Lark, Meadow Titling, Moor Tit or Titling, lleatlier-Lintie, Moss-Cheeper, Ling bird. Meadow Lark. \\u2014 A verv common bird here, both in the enclosed lands and especially on the moors. It is amusing to observe how they sometimes wind their way among the Img, instead of flying from the place at which they have alighted. Its nest is always on the ground, sometimes in the middle of a grass or corn-Geld, sometimes nearer the hedge, but always so placed as to be very well if not very closely concealed. One I found accidentally on the moor was in the side of a cavity left by the extraction of a huge surface block of stone, in a kind of small hollow or recess, and completely covered in by earth and ling. In addition to its five proper eggs, this nest contained a Cuckoo's tg'^. The nest is made of bents, lined with the same and some hairs. Tlie eggs are from four to sLx, and vary in colour. Mr. Yarrell's descri|)- tion is, \\\" of a reddish Iwown colour, mottled over with darker brown.\\\" The red is hardly discoverable, if at all, in some I have, and I should have said \\\"dusky brown.\\\" \\u2014 Fig.2\\\\, plate III. 84. ROCK VlVVY.\\u2014{AniInis petrosus). Dusky Lark, Rock Lark, Eicld Lark, Sea Titling, Sea Liutie. This bird, it seems, was long confounded with the two last. It is seldom met with far inland, and is not always found near rocks, notwithstanding its name. It is a ground-builder, and where there are rocks handy, the nest is very likely to be oa their ledges, if only a little grass or the like grows there. It is composed of various diy grasses, and contains four or five eggs of a greenish cast, and mottled with dusky brown or da'is cinereous markings. 85. RICHARD'S '^lVlT.\\u2014{Anthus Ricardi).

Only a very few of these birds have been met with in Britain. 87. SKY LARK \\u2014 {Alauda arvensis). Lark, Field Lark, Lavrock. \\u2014 Very few words of description are requisite in the case of tliis everywhere famihar and favouiite Bongster. Up in the sky, and soaring still, he pours out his joyous strains, suggesting to us much more forcibly than any other bird does in its song the thought that it is offering praise and thanks to Him who made and preserves the fowl that fly in the air, as well as all other creatures. So that the thought in the old German Hymn, \\u2014 \\\" Hark ! Hark ! the Lark at Heaven s gate sings,\\\" seems not fanciful to us, but solemn truth. Once last summer 1 \\u25a0was speaking the solemn words, \\\" dust to dust, ashes to ashes,\\\" over a dead parishioner, followed as they so soon are by the telling of our \\\" sm-e and certain hope of a joyful resurrection,\\\" when a Sky Lark, right over our heads, broke out into his sweet, simple, thankful, hopeful, joyous melody, and by it spoke to more sad hearts than one in that sQent company. Up, up, to the skv was Ids pathway, and the song and the soaring both said tliat a \\\"joyful resurrection\\\" was no \\\" cunningly devised fable.\\\" The Sky Lark's nest is always on the ground, often near the edge of a furrow, sometimes near a little grassy unevenness of the surface, sometimes even, cunningly concealed in a dry grassy grip by the side of a field at the foot of a low hedge-bank. It is but a slight and inartificial structure, of bents lined with finer grasses and a few fibrous roots. The eggs, which I never knew WOOD LAHK. 71 to exceed five in number, vary as much in general colour and markings as the Tree Pipit's and quite baffle verbal description. I found three in a nest two years ago, altogether dusky in general iiue and so dark that I can hardly use the word brown in describing the shade ; wliile generally \\\" dark grey\\\" and \\\" ash brown \\\" will succeed in conveying an idea of the mottliugs characterising the egg. Besides which, by no means a small proportion of a large collection of Sky Lark's eggs wUl always be found to show a prevaiUng tinge of green in the sui-face colouring. The Lark is a very faitliful mother, and will not easily be induced to leave her nest ; and even when the nest has become quite untenable longer, from any cause, the parent birds have been known to move both eggs and young to a safer place, by grasping them with the long prehensile claws of their feet. \\u2014 Fi^. 24, plaie III. 88. TYOOD LARK\\u2014 (Ala uda ardorea). The Sky Lark is seen everywhere; on the moors here in small parties, on the Saltings ia Essex and other southern counties, in our meadows and corn-fields all over the kingdom. The TVood Lark, on the other hand, is strictly local, though sufficiently abundant where it does occur. I knew, in one case, where a shot was fired at a lot of Larks in the snow, that out of five or six which were kiUed all but one proved to be Wood Larks. So local is it, that though I have been a resident in Essex, Suffolk, Cambridgeshire, Herefordshire, Berwickshire, anc' Yorkshire, as well as a visitor in other counties, I have never lived among or near its haunts, saving ordy in the western-most county named. The nest is formed on the ground, usually well concealed by grass or a neighbouring scrubby bush, is composed of dry grass and moss, and lined with fibres and a few hairs. The eggs are four or five in number, of a lighter ground-colour (but 12 BRITISH I3I11DS, THEIR EGGS AND NESTS. scurcely less ia size) than those of the Sky Lark, vary very little comparatively in their general appearance, and often in addition to the ash brown or greenish hue of the superficial frecklings and mottlings, are marked by the presence of a few wine-red blotches. Tlie young are much sought for to keep in cages, as they soon begin to sing very freely. The song of the Wood Lark in a state of nature is one of the sweetest, in some respects, with wliich I am acquainted. \\u2014 Fi_^. ^o, plate III. 89. SHORT-TOED 'LK^Y.\\u2014{Alatida hrachydadyla).

Tawny Bunting, Mountain Bunting, Snow-flake or-fleck. \\u2014 Only a winter visitor in tliis country, though often coming in not very scanty numbers. I have frequently seen tlicm on our North Yorkshire moors, and liave heard of tliem as seen in flocks of large dimensions. One informant told me he had seen as many as two hundred together. It breeds in countries very far to the North, and, like otlier indigenes of the North, is subject to considerable variations in colour according to season. So much so, that the bii'd which used to be called Tawny Bunting in its summer plumage, was re-christened by the name of Snow Bunting, to suit its winter dress, wliile the young bird was called by tlio name of Mountain Bunting. 92. COMMON BUNTING\\u2014 (ff^/im^a miliaria). Bunting, Coi-n Bunting, Ebb. \\u2014 The name of this bird shows BLACK-HEADED BUNTING. 73 that it is not by any means rare in perhaps most of our country districts. It often utters its not very musical cry seated on a tall spray in a hedge, and sometinies wliile flying along. The nest is always made very near the ground, if not actually on it, usually among stunted bushes or coarse herbage. It is made of roots, bents or coarser materials yet, and lined M-ith hair. The Bunting lays four or five eggs, of a kind of stained- white ground, suggesting the idea that a vinous-red stain has been imperfectly washed off, and blotched and streaked and speckled, in the characteristic Bunting style, with sliades of purplish brown, some of them rather dark. Though called Com Bunting, it may be found where corn-fields are not abundant. I once met with a nest at the foot of St. Abb's Head.\\u2014 /'/y. 1, plate IF. 93. BLACK-HEADED 'm'^Tm(j<\\u2014{Emberizascha-niclus). Reed Sparrow, Reed Bunting, Water Sparrow, ]\\\\Iountain Sparrow, Black-bonnet. \\u2014 Not a rare bird anywhere in England, I believe, where water is not rare ; and very conspicuous from the dark head and bright plumage of the male. On the Essex marshes it is common enougli, and so it is in the marshy or illdrained meadows of other counties. Mr. Yarrell says the \\\" nest is jreneraUy placed on tlie ground, among coarse long grass or rushes, at the foot of a thorn, or on the side of a canal bank.\\\" The last I found was among, and sapported by, the sedges growing at the side of a marsh-ditch in Essex, and not less than ten or twelve inches from the bank \\u2014 a site which I believe is not an unusual one. It is made of grasses, fragments of rushes, stalks of diffcTcnt plants, and lined sometimes with rred-dowm, or finer grasses and a little moss. I dislodged the male l)ird from the nest just named, and the eggs were perfectly warm to tiie touch. They would have been hatched in a few days. It was 74 BRITISH BIRDS, TU\\u00a3IR EGGS AND NESTS. thus proved that the male E,eed Bimting takes his share in sitting, and tlie position of the nest among green and growing sedges adds one more fact to what is known of its nidiflcation. The eggs are four or five in number, of a pale reddish-brown colour, streaked and spotted with dark brown of a rich purple shade. \\u2014 Eig. 3, plate IF. 94. YELLOW HAMMER\\u2014 (^;/i^mz\\u00ab citrmella). Yellow Bunting, Yellow Yowley, Gold-spink, Yellow teldi-ing, Yellow Yoldriug, or Yeorling, Yeldrock, Yellow Yite, Yoit, &c. \\u2014 I used to hear in Berwickshire, that \\\" The Brock, the Toad, and the Yellow YeOrling, Get a drap o' the Deil's bluid ilka May morning.\\\" I wonder what they all do with it, and how the plentiful bleeding affects the patient. Por there is certainly no lack of Yellow Hammers all over the country ; and if one looks at the long strings of blown birds' eggs festooned at cottage doors, or hung over the cottage or farm-house mantel-piece, the trophies of some yotuig nest-taking hopeful dwelling there, after the Blackbirds' and Thi-ushes' eggs, the most abundant are almost always those of the Yellow Hammer. We all know his rich plumage and somewhat plaintive song, which, in my school-boy days, used to be Englished into \\\" A very, very little bit of bread and n-o-o c-h-e-e-e-s-e ! \\\" It does not spare materials when engaged in building its nest. Dead grass, small sticks and moss, a fcT? feathers and plentiful hair to form the lining, are ready enough in our fields for its use, and the structure compacted with them is placed usually in a low, thick bush on a hedge-bank, well concealed, and but little raised above the soil. Sometimes I have found it in a rough grass-field, amid tufts of rushes and other such-like growth. Sometimes even in a wall-tree, as in my own ;;uden last year ; or in an evergreen shrub, also in my garden a CHAFFINCH. /5 year or two since. But the hedge side is the rule. The eegs, tiiree to fh'e in number, and often very round in shape, vary considerably in individual cases, but never so much as to leave the accustomed eye in a moment's doubt as to what bird the egp; belongs to. Of a white ground-colour, scarcely tinged at ali with vinous red, or perhaps much suffused, all of them are streaked and veined and spotted with dark, brown with a shade of red in it. They are beautiful eggs to my eye. \\u2014 Fig. 3, plate IK. 95. GIRL BUNTING\\u2014 (^;;<imr\\u00ab cirlus). French Yeliow Hammer, Black-throated YeUow Hammer. \\u2014 A bird long overlooked by our native ornithologists, and perhaps more frequently occurring than is even yet suspected. Still it is by no means a very common bird, \\u2014 though identified as occurring in, perhaps, most of the southern counties. Tlie Rev. Orpen Morris, from whose work on British Bnds and Eggs 1 have taken the two provincial names given above, says, \\\" the ne&t is placed in furze or low bushes, and is usually made of dry stalks of grass and a little moss, liued -uith hair and small roots. Some are wholly without moss or hair . . . the small roots constituting the Uning. The eggs are four or five in number, of a dull, bluish white, streaked and speckled with dark brown.

It would be a shame if he, with his gay dress and handsome appearance, were the bachelor he is called in his Latin name. It is, however, only at one period of the year that the sexes in the Cliaffinch tribe (as in many other kinds of birds) separate. The song of tlie Cliaffinch, though not of great compass or variety, is very cheery and sweet, and very different from his melancholy sound of \\\" Weet, weet,\\\" which many country people take as a prognostication of rain ; \\u2014 whence his local name of Wet-bird. The nest, always in a tree-fork or bush or hedge, always firmly and securely built in, always contrived and fashioned with a wonderful compactness, neatness and beauty, is formed of mosses, with various-shaded lichens on the surface, and lined with wool and hair and feathers, the last two being the finishing substances. I never knew more than five eggs to be laid, oftener four, of a peculiar winy-red dun, spotted and streaked \\u2014 and most near the large end\\u2014 with a rich, dark Sienna brown.

It nests in holes in pollard or otlier trees, or in thatch, in company with other Sparrows of the common species, but in this case always in holes entered from the outside, not from the inside of tlic roof of the building. Sometimes it has been ascertained to breed in nests made within deserted nests of a Magpie, or some such bird. The nest, like that of the Common Sparrow, is formed of dry grass or hay, or flue straw, and abundantly lined with feathers of all sorts. ITie eggs, four or five in general, are distinctly less than those of the House Sparrow, and with more decided brown in the markings on the ground-colour of soiled white. \\u2014 Fig. 6, jilate IV. 100. HOUSE S7AKR0W\\u2014 {Passer domesticus).

And whether he be sooty and blacK with the smoke of mid-London, or with his colours pure and unsmirched and bright as in the clear breezy village, he *\\u25a0 is stiU always the same pert, impudent creature, whose name has passed almost into a proverb for bold familiarity. Ubiquitous as he is by habit and system, his nest is found in sites almost as various and as numerous us, the places of his residence. Under the tUes or eaves of buildings, in the thatch-edges of a bam, in holes in the interior of a thatch-roof, in water-pipes and receivers for eaves-gutters, in holes in walls or old buildings, in ivy clothing either a wall or a tree, in fir trees, in wall-trees, especially if large and high, below Rooks' nests, in deserted ucsls of large 78 BRITISH BIRDS, TUEIR EGGS AXD NESTS. birds, \\u2014 frequent in all these sites, it seem diflicult to say where it may not be found. Often, too, it becomes a mass of straw and dry grass and lavish feather-lining, big enough to fill a man's hat of large size. The eggs are very various in the intensity of their surface markiugs.

Neither does it yield an insignificant portion of the egg spoUs of the country-boy. The nest is usually built in a hedge, and it dearly loves a thick massive thorn hedge for the purpose. In one such, bordering an orchard in Essex, of perhaps seventy or eighty yards long, I found one day a dozen or more of Greenfinches' nests, almost aJl with eggs in. It is, however, not seldom to be met with in an evergreen or other bush in tne garden ; sometimes in a fir tree, and again in a fruit or ornamental tree. The materials employed are roots, moss, grass, with a lining of the same, only finer, and plentiful hair. I have often noticed the presence of a kind of scrubby scales about the interior of one of their nests. The eggs are four, five, or six. in number, and vary much in size and but little in general appearance. They are white, suffused with a bluish tinge, and with reddish or purple spots and streaks, intermingled with some of a darker shade. \\u2014 Fig. 8, plate IV. GOLDFINCH. 73 102.

It is not uncommon about Epping Eorest, and has been found nearer London, and in many of the Southern counties. Mr. Doubleday has given the best account of its habits generally, as well as of its nest and eggs. It seems to have no peculiar situation for its nest preferred to all others, but builds indiscriminately in trees or bushes, and at various heights from the ground. The nest is said to be made of twigs, \\\" with fibrous roots and grey lichens laid flat on them;\\\" the whole structure being such as to remind one of the Ring-dove's flat platform of a nest. The eggs \\\" vary from four to six, and are of a pale olivegreen, spotted with black, and streaked with dusky grey.\\\" ]\\\\Ir. Doubleday adds, that some are much less marked than others.

It is much sought after for keeping in cages, and is caught for that purpose in numbers by the professional bird-catchers. It builds a beautifully neat and pretty nest ; sometimes in a bush or evergreen, often in the fork of an apple or other fruit-tree, and more rarely m a hedge. It is formed of moss, fir-needles, green bents, wool, thistle-dowTi, willow-down, feathers, hairs, &c., according to the choice afforded by the locality of the nest. The eggs are four or five in number, are bluish white or pale grey, spotted 80 BRITIsn BIRDS, TUER EGGS AND NESTS. with greyish purple and red bro^ni, and sometimes a little streaked with the same. \\u2014 Fig. 10, plate IV. 104.

The male in his full plum.age, with red poll and rose breast and bright brown plumage, is a handsome bird, and, compared with the female or the young, a very \\\" fine bird\\\" indeed. It is common enough in most districts, and pretty sui-e to be met with where there is much furze. The nest is frequently to be found in the midst of thick furze covers ; but like Mr. Ilewitson, I have found it commonly in thickish thorn-hedges, and very often in small and single furze bushes. It is made of small twigs and bents and moss, and often lined with a copious cushion of woo) merely; at other times, with some hair and vegetable down. The eggs vary greatly in size, as well as in colour and markings, but usually they are of a pale bluish-white ground, speckled with red of different shades, brown to pui-ple. They are four, five, and sometimes six in number. \\u2014 Fig. 11, plate IF. lOG. MEALY IlEDPOLE\\u2014 (Zjwoifa canetcens).

It is known to breed in Yorkshire and the northern English counties as well as in Scotland, the Hebrides, &c. As its name leads one to infer, it is usually found in the neighboui-hood of hill or fell. The nest is built on the ground, among the short benty grass of the hiU-side or the dwarf ling of similar localities, or even among longer heather, and is made of the materiab afforded by such herbage, and moss, and lined with fibrous roots, wool and hair. The eggs vary from four to six in number, are ahnost white with the faintest blue or green tinge, spotted with red, brown or dark purple, with sometimes a few streaks of a lighter red tinge. \\u2014 Fig 13, plate IF. 109.

The Bullfinch is also one of those birds who have long been laid under proscription, for the mischief he is assumed to do to the buds of fruit trees. Lilvc as rewards used to be customarily paid in hosts of places out of the Parish funds for the heads of SpaiTOws, Tomtits, &c., so has it been on a lesser scale with our present birds, and I cannot help thinking equally unjustly. No doubt the \\\" Olph\\\" commits sad apparent havock on the blossom-buds ; but I suspect the blossom-buds damaged by him (as it seems) would never have come to anything if no Bullfinoh had ever been near them. There was a grub in each of tliem, and that grub would have destroyed the bud quite as effectually, if not qmte as summarily, as the bird which extracted it from what was alike its hiding-place and scene of active ravage and consumption. Unlike the Ping Dove and Missel Thrush, and a few other birds, which are usually very wild and shy, but at breeding time lay aside their wildness and distrust, and come to the close neighbourhood of human habitations to nest, the Bullfinch, in spring, leaves our gardens and orchards and resorts to the woods and wilds. The nest is made of twigs and roots and moss, rather loosely constructed, and lined with wool and hair, and is most commonly placed in a good thick bush of considerable height Mid size ; sometimes on a fir or other tree. The hen-bird lays four or five eggs of a pale greenish blue, streaked and spotted M-ith purple-red, chiefly at the larger end. \\u2014 Firj. 1^, plate IF. 110.

This is a bird which deserves a little notice at our hands on two or tliree grounds. In its plumage it varies more, according to sex or age, than perhaps any other English bii'd in a state of nature. It is kideed subject to almost startling dissimilarity. The peculiar shape and action of the bill is also noteworthy, and the strengtli of the muscles which move the mandibles may be judged of by the powerful effect produced m startiag the scales of the strongest fir-cones. Again, it has been repeatedly met mth in this country in large numbers ; and not only so, out at such seasons as to render it almost positive, that it must have nested, or be nesting here : nay even females which were obtained showed, by the state of their plumage, that they must have been so engaged : and yet until recently, no authentic observation has been recorded of the actual occurrence of its nest and eggs. It is now believed to breed in the very earliest spring or indeed in winter, which may account for the obscurity hiiherto attending its nesting habits. The nest is made of twigs below, with grassy bents upon such foundation, bound together with wool and lined with hair. The eggs seem to vary much in colour, showing a sensible degree of resemblance to those of the Greenfinch, but with a generally warmer tint, and spots of a much more decided or dark red shade. \\u2014 Fig. 15, plate IF. 112.

Common Starling, Stare, Sheep-stare, Solitary Tlirush, BroAnti Starling. \\u2014 Ttie two last of these names used to be applied to the young of the Starling. Tew cases of more brUliant Tihimage are met with in our English birds than in the instance of the male of the Common Starling. The metallic glow and play of colours in the feathers of his head, neck and back is very beautiful. It is a very abundant bird, and it is supposed by some that there are some peculiarities in its breeding habits. I mean that I have heard it asserted that the male is a polygamist, or rather perhaps a bigamist. I never saw any thing within my own scope of observation which led me to suspect it, but rather to hold the received belief that the Starling pairs exactly as most other birds do. They are exceedingly pertinacious in adhering to their clioice of a place for nesting in. I knew one case in which from the inconvenient nature of the nest-site selected, one of the birds was shot. In a very short space the survivor had paired again, and the gun again dissolved the union. The whole process was repeated five or six times, and the Starlings bred at last in the place chosen by the original pair. The nest is found in a great variety of situations, \\u2014 in the bowl of a water pipe from the eaves of a house, in a dove-cot, in holes in trees, below the nests in a rookery, in holes in old buildings or more recent masonry, between the slates and underdrawing of a roof, in holes in steep high rocks, in chimneys of houses, and the like. It is made, without stint of materials, of straw, roots, grass, and a plentiful lining of feathers. The eggs, four to six in number, vary strangely in size but not in colour, which is of a uniform pale blue. In some districts where the Starling abounds, they collect in huge flocks, the youn^' HAVEN. 85 with the parents, and may be seen when on the wing like a cloud from a great distance. \\u2014 lig. 1, plate V. 11\\u00a3 KOSE-COLOURED PASTOR\\u2014 CPas^r roseus).

Persecuted by the gamekeeper, sought after for domestication, or their eggs taken for sale to the collector, they are becoming very rare in many a part of the country where not long Bince they were frequently seen.

I did it in jeopardy however, for the Ravens were very bold, and every moment I expected they would assail me, ia spite of the short bludgeon I had suspended to my wrist. Ths appearance below the nest of the farmer in whose fields the Raveu tree grew, decided the question \\u2014 perhaps he frightened tlie Ravens as weU as threatened me ; perhaps they knew he came as their protector \\u2014 anyhow I did not get my egg, although I had actually liad it in my hand. The nest is a great pile of sticks, lined with wool and roots and felts of hair, and often has four or five eggs laid in it, of a light green ground-shade, blotched and spotted with browns of varying depth of colour, but some of them very dark. \\u2014 Fig. 3, Tplate V. 118.

Waterton calls him his \\\" Warrior bird\\\"), and a young and weakly lamb, a young Hare or Rabbit, a wounded or frightened Partridge has little or no chance with him. I knew a case a year or two since of a Crow attacking a Partridge and driving it to cover in a hedge, where it lay so terrified and exliausted as to suffer itself to be picked up by a spectator. I knew another instance years ago iu which the Crow attacked a young Rabbit. The old doe came to the assistance of her young one, and the 'oattle was well contested, but tlie Crow was the victor, and carried off the spoil. ROCK. 87 Paired once, these birds, as in the case of the Raven, are paii-ed for good. The nest is placed in a main fork of a large tree, and is made of sticks and twigs with abundant cushioning of wool and hair. It is believed not to bmld a new nest every year. It lays four or five eggs, varying much in the depth of the tiut of the greenish ground-colour, and generally weU mottled and blotched and spotted with greenish ash colour and bright brown. The parents seem to expel their young from the immediate precincts of their own abode very soon after they are able to provide for themselves ; as is the case with the Raven also. \\u2014 Fig. 4, 'plate V. 119.

It has been very seldom known to breed in England, though coming m great abundance from its more northern haunts before the access of winter. In north and west Scotland, the Hebrides and Orkneys it breeds in large numbers, and rewards for its destruction have been customarily paid to within a recent period, if indeed they have altogether ceased yet. They place their nests among rocks, in the rifts or on ledges. These are built of ling, sticks, roots, stalks of plants, seaweed ; and lined with wool and hair. There are usually four or five eggs, not differing very materially in colouring from those of the Common Crow. \\u2014 Fig. 5, flate V. 120. ROOK\\u2014 ( Corrws frugilegus) .

In the country some of the most familiar sights aud sounds are those afforded by the Rookery, or by tlie huge assemblages of Rooks about the fields or winging their morning or evening lliglit in quest of food, or in return to their domiciles. Most of us too have heard of Rook courts of justice, and the sentences awarded against the ^vrongful spoilers of a neighbour's nest, as well as the battles to resist such an invasion. It is ce?-tauily a remarkable instinct, wliich, to so great a degree, forbids birds building in communities to pliuider the building materials placed on the adjoining bough or ledge, and no wonder that Instinct has provided a remedy for what must be looked upon, when it occurs to any extent, as a somewhat unnatural offence. The Rook resorts to the same nest year after year, merely making such repairs as a year's wear and tear from wind and rain and accident nave rendered necessary. When the nest is ready, four or five eggs are deposited, of a greenish ground-colour more or less intense in shade, plentifully mottled and blotched with darker \\u2022jnd varying shades of brownish green. Many of the eggs strongly resemble tliose of the Crow, while others are much more like those of the Jackdaw. As in the case of the Bullfinch tlie Rook is often blamed for doing mischief which was really done by the creature which formed tlie real object of search to the supposed offender. The wireworm and the grub of the cockchafer do infinite damage in grass or cornfields by eating ofi the roots of the plants in question. Tiie Rook pulls up these ruined plants ajid eats the offending larva. The farmer or supcrucial observer only sees the dead grass or com plant, and loolishly accuses the Rook, and persecutes him, though in reality a friend and benefactor, to the death. Not but what the Rook does niLseblef at times ; for I have often seen newly sown corn-fields MAGPIE. 89 black with them, and have bccu coutiuually a witness to the very extensive damage done to the potato crop just when the young tubers were in most active growth and most susceptible of harm. Still, a few precautions will suffice to protect both cornlejQ and potato-crop during the brief space while protection is necessary, and the balance of good done is so greatly on the preaoininaling side, that the Rook may well continue to be protected. Rook shooting has charms for many. For myself I seem to see cruelty so conspicuous about the whole process, that I cannot conceive in what the pleasure consists. \\u2014 'Eig. 6, ]plata V. 121.

They breed in many places in the immediate neighbourhood of my residence in very considerable numbers, in the holes and crevices which abound among craggy rocks and precipices that rise high above steep wooded banks. Besides, they build in ruinous buildings, in church towers of pigeon-houses, in little used chimneys, in holes in modern masonry, even in deserted chambers. The pile of materials amassed is simply wonderful, and really they are sometimes so laid together as if intended to serve no other purpose but to lengthen out the nest-pile for a builder's amusement. Sticks and wool are the substances usually employed, and the eggs laid vary, as to number, between three and sii. They are of a pale bluish-white, well spotted with ash colour light brown and dark brown. \\u2014 lig. 7, plate V. 122. IklAGPIE\\u2014 (PiVa cauda(a).

It is almost idle to say no such variety or distinction really exists. The materials of the nest are cliiefly sticks, plastered with earth inside, and lined with roots and hair. There are often as many as six or seven eggs laid in it, pale bluish-white in colour, spotted all over, and abundantly so in general, with grey and greenish brown of more than one shade. \\u2014 Fi/g. 8, plate V. 123.

It is a shy bii'd, seldom, seen far from its haunts in woods and copses, though when seen, it is noticeable enough from a certain peculiarity in its flight, due to a sort of fluttering use or motion of its wings. It is easily domesticated, and b?.conics a tame and amusing pet. The nest is very often extremely rude and inartificial, almost as much so as the Ring Dove's.

The Green Woodpecker is the most common, and much the best known of all our English Woodpeckers. Besides being a very handsome bird, its organization (as is indeed the case with aU the tribe) is so beautifully adapted to its mode of life, as to merit a brief notice at our hands. Its strong prehensile feet and claws, two toes being directed forward and two backwards, fit it not only for moving in all directions, and with wonderful readiness and ease in any direction whatever, about the trunk or limbs of a tree, but also for grasping the surface with great tenacity when necessity arises 92 UKITISII BIIIDS, TUEIK KGGS AND NESTS, for applying its strong bill to penetrating or disloding either bark or portions of the wood itself. When thus occupied, the tail comes into use, and the bones at the lower extremity of the skeleton are so formed as to enable the stifT, pointed tail-feathers to be appHcd to the tree in such a way as to strengthen the purchase already obtained by the firm foot-hold. Add to all this the length of the tongue, its great extensibility, specially provided for by a peculiar arrangement of muscles, together with the structure of the tongue itself \\u2014 remarkable for its sharp, horny tip and barb like bristles on either side near the point \\u2014 and we Lave one of Nature's most beautiful accommodations of means to the intended end which can well be offered to our admiring notice . The undulating flight and laugh-like cry of the Green Woodpecker used to be more common than they seem to be now, and the great multiplicity of provincial names seems to show that once it must have been an exceedingly common bh-d. I have rarely seen or heard it here : and no wonder. For where once there were mUcs of forest, now we have scarcely 100 acres of wood in the whole district. This Woodpecker's cry is loudly and frequently uttered befoie unpending rain ; whence one of its common or by-names. It breeds in holes in trees, which it often excavates in part or enlarges to suit its wants. It makes no nest, but deposits its eggs, four to seven in number, and perfectly white, on a bed of the soft decayed wood of the tree. The eggs average rather over l|-inchin length, by about |-inch broad. Ko LUustration being possible in ouj: space of purely white eggs I tliink it better to append their measurements. 127.

It seems to prefer the vicinity of woods, but may be seen occasionally where woods do not abound, and sometimes even it resorts to places where abundance of old posts or decaying tree-trunks lead it to expect a plentiful repast. It breeds ia holes in trees, making no nest, and laying its four or five eggs on just such a bed as its green namesake. The female is very averse to leaving her eggs, and shows aimost aa much pertinacity as a Tomtit in abiding by tliem. They are 1 inch long by |-incli broad. 12S. LESSER SPOTTED WOODVECKER\\u2014(Picus minor). Barred \\\"Woodpecker, Ilick-wall, Little Black and Wlxite Woodpecker, Crank -bird. \\u2014 A pretty little bird, very shy, very active, very able to keep itself out of sight, and so, hardly noticed by one in a hundred of those whom Miss Edgeworth would class as more or less nearly connected with the widely-spread family of No-eyes. It is said to prefer large woods of Beech ; and like the other Woodpeckers, makes no nest, but places its eggs in a hoUow tree, accessible by only a small hole, the means of access being often at a considerable distance from the eggs laid below. The eggs of this little bird are four or five in number, purely white, though seeming to be suffused with a delicate pink hue before they are blown, which arises from the transparency of the ihell. They are about l-inch long by rather more than |-inch broad. 129. ^YRYKF.CK~(runx torquilla). Cuckoo's-mate, Emmet-hunter, Snake-bird, Long-tongue. \\u2014 k 94 BRITISH BIRDS, THEIR EGGS AND NESTS. dear little bird is the Wryneck, with his cheery spring-aimouncmg cry. We willingly pardon its want of melody for its associations. The marvellous rapidity with which its tongue is darted out and retracted, enabling it by the aid of the glutinous secretion with which its end is furnished to secure an Ant at every action, is highly interesting as illustrating another of the wonderful and beautiful adaptations provided by the Divine Artificer of all The Wryneck makes scarcely any nest (if any), but lays its eggs on the fragments of decayed wood which Ime a hole in a tree. They are from six to ten in number, and white and glossy, and about the same size as those of the Barred Wood-pecker. The old bu-d is singularly unwilling to leave her eggs under any intrusion, and tries by such means as hissing sharply, elevating her crest and contorting her neck, to intimidate or deter the intruder. II.\\u2014 CERTHIADJ2. 130. CRYEVER\\u2014iCeri/iia familiaris). Tree-creeper, Tree-climber. \\u2014 A shy, gentle-seeming little bird, shunning observation, and, with the rest of its neighbours in our catalogue, possessing a singular facility of quietly and rapidly shiftuig its place on the trunlc or limb of a tree, so as always to interpose an efficient screen between its own minute body and the eye of any passer-by. Its claws, sharp and long and curved, aided by its long and pointed tail-feathers, are its chief machinery in these facile motions. It builds its nest, generally speaking, in a hole in a tree, with only a very minute aperture. Sometimes, though I think rarely, the nest is outside the tree, but screened from observation by some casual dislodgement of the bark, or in some similar way. It is made of dry grass, small twigs, shreds of moss, with a lining of feathers. It is very hard to distinguish Oft between the eggs of the Creeper, which number from six to nine, and those of the Blue Tit-mouse and the Willow-wren, not to mention one or two other small birds. The illustration will give a better idea of the egg than many lines of description. \\u2014 Fij. 16, fLate IV. 131. y^^^l^\\u2014 [Troglodytes vulgaris). Jenny Wren, Kitty Wren, Titty Wren, Cutty Wren.\\u2014 A kind of natural pet with every one. I scarcely ever remember to have spoken of the Wren, or heard others speak of it, without some gentle, loving epithet applied to its name. The provincial names quoted are instances of what I mean, and how often the words \\\"poor,\\\" \\\"little,\\\" \\\"tiny,\\\" and even \\\"dear,\\\" are jomed to the ;)refixes of Jenny, or Kitty, or Titty. Its little song, its seeming incapacity to bear the rude buffets of storm and cold, its quiet peculiar movements, all tend to commend it to our kmdly notice. And then the beautiful nest it makes \\u2014 such a great pile for such a tiny builder \\u2014 and so compact and warm and wonderfully concealed by the use of the nicest adaptations of materials and design to the site selected, \\u2014 this makes us almost respectfully admire, in addition to our love. I have found it on the mosscovered bank, on the moss-covered trunk of a tree, in thatch, in a haulm wall ; but wherever it is found, the adjacent substances are made to help the concealment. One would think that when strength and ability, seemingly so inadequate, had been so heavily tasked as is implied in the construction of such a nest, the little birds would not be likely to leave it, especially with the bmlding of another in immediate prospect. But I have not found it so in practice. A very trifling enlargement of the single orifice, or straining of the fabric, in the effort to send the finger to the bottom of the nest, is quite sufficient to cause the nest to be deserted ; especially if the Wrens owning it have 9f> mUTISlf BIRDS, THEIR EGGS AND NESTS. once or more been disturbed when in it, or very near it. When the young ones are liatched, the case is altered. The eggs are often from six to nine or ten in number, and I liave heard of even more. They are white, with almost always a few pale red spots about them. The male is said to feed the female during the period of closest incubation. Many other bu'ds ccrtaiiJy have the same habit, even when the mate has left the nest just to stretch her wings, as it were. I have seen the Common Linnet do this. \\u2014 lig. 17, 'plate IV. 132. HOOPOE\\u2014 (C/>Ki;a e/)o;w.) A casual visitor only, but still not so rare that specimens are not obtained almost every year. In fact, the whole appearance of the bird is so very striking, that it is scarcely possible such a risitor should pass without notice. It breeds in several European countries. 133. NUT-HATCH\\u2014 (&Y^\\u00ab Europcea). Nut-jobber, \\\"VVood-cracker. \\u2014 A very beautiful bird to my eye, with liis bright slate-coloured back, and orange breast, and black bill ; and a very great pet in former days. I had a pair which had never known a day of constraint, but wliich, by patient feeding and care to make them fearless of me, became so tame as almost to take food from my hand ; to take it readily when I jerked it a foot or two into the an-. And they would always come to my signal for them \\u2014 a few blows on the tree at which I fed them. But they never suffered their young to come to the feast I provided, and always absented themselves for about a month at the breeding time. The nest is, I believe, always made in the hole of a tree, and if the aperture to the hollow is too large, the bird is apt to lessen it by the application of a sort of mud-plaster to some portions of the edge. The nest is Ci.CKOO. 97 rather a eontiast tu that, of tlic little \\\"VVrcnjust named, being little more than a loose heap of moss, small twigs, aud chips of Dark and wood. The eggs are five or six and sometimes, it is said, seven in number, white, with some pale-red spots. Many of them are very like the Larger Titmouse's. \\u2014 T'uj. IS, plate IV. III.\\u2014 CUCULTD^.. 134. CUCKOO\\u2014 ((7?^\\u00ab<fo5 canorus:) Gowk. \\u2014 Have you heard the Cuckoo yet? How often that question is asked by one's friends or neighbours in the country. Hearing the first Cuckoo and seeiug the first Swallow are always events to true lovers of country scenes aud objects and sounds. But what a strange instuict it is which forbids our Cuckoo to build a nest, and instructs it to lay its t^'^ \\u2014 at least to place it \\u2014 in some other bird's nest, and tha'>, bird usually not one-fifth its own size ! A Blackbird's nest is sometimes selected to receive the deposit, but very rarely compared with the Hedge Sparrow's, the Lark's, the ]\\\\Icadow Pipit's, the Water Wagtail's, or the Chaffinch's. How many eggs are laid by a single Cuckoo in a season, is, I think, not ascertained. It is, however, a very rare circumstance to find more than one Cuckoo's c^^ in any given nest, and then open to great doubt if both were placed there by the same Cuckoo. It is a matter of dispute how the ^2^^ is actually deposited in the nest selected ; whether \\\" laid\\\" in, or placed in \\u2014 after being dropped on the ground suppose \\u2014 by the bill or claws. I found one in the Meadow Pipit's nest mentioned above (p. 69), where the position and site of the nest were such as to leave no doubt whatever in my mind that the egg could not possibly have been \\\"laid\\\" in tJie nest ; and almost certAinlv inserted bv aid of the heal. How IHp (\\\"'ucAno 93 BRITISU BIRDS, THEIR EGGS AND NESTS. found such a nest at all, was a marvel to me. The eggs are verj' small for the size of the bird which produces them, and strongly resemble some of the darker and more closely freckled specimens of the House Sparrow's egg, but are ratlier larger in size; while Mr. Doubleday says some of them resemble those of the Pied WagtaW.\\u2014Fi^. 19, plafe 1 V. 135.

Beyond doubt, as far as exceeding brilliancy of plumage goes, the most beautiful of our indigenous birds. I have never seen it in any part of the kingdom a numerous bird, though in my fishing and other excursions in Suffolk, Essex, Norfolk, and Herefordshire, I used to see many pairs ; each, however, domiciled at some distance from its nearest neighbours. In the district of North Yorkshire I am best acquainted with I have never seen it. Its straight, arrow-like, speeding flight is sure to be remembeured, when once seen, and so is the odour inseparable from its nesthole or other stated haunt. A hole, sloping upwards, in the ^ank of the water it uaost frequents, whether jjond, stream. 99 marsh, dit.cii, or large river, is usually clioscu to receive the uest, which is often a foot and a half, or two feet from the entrance; but sometimes the bird has been known to resort to a hole at some distance from any water. The nest, so called, seems to be constituted of small fish-bones, ejected from the King-fisher's stomach, and the dry soil of the hole, while the eggs deposited in it are five or six in number, very round in form, beautifully white when blown, and though, from the thinness of the shell, seeming to have a pink hue before the removal of the yolk. ' III.\\u2014 HIRUNDINID^. 139. SWALLOW\\u2014 {Illniudo rustica). Common Swallow, House Swallow, Chimney Swallow, Bam Swallow. \\u2014 One of the most welcome of all our spring visitors ; and so frequently coming back, the self-same pair of birds apparently, to the self-same nest, that they seem to be almost like members of the family returnmg from a temporary absence. The common name. Chimney Swallow, is, however, rather a misnomer. No doubt they build in chimneys freely and frequently, but in many districts the chimney is quite untenanted by any Swallows, while the open roofs of sheds and barns, the under side of bridges sufficiently flat and uneven to afford the necessary support, disused shafts of mines, and the bice, and even parts of unused rooms, or articles of fui'uiture in such rooms, are resorted to. These nests are very considerably different from those of the Martin (to be noticed next), inasmuch as th(;y are always completely open above, being so built that there is a sensible space between the greater portion of tlie edge of the plaster-work of the nest, and the roof or other surface above ; whiie in the case of the Martin's nest, it is always bmlt so as to be closed above by the eaves or other ledge to which it is affixed, requiring a gap or 100 BRITIsn BIKDS, THEIR EGGS AND NESTS. lip \\u2014 SO to speak \\u2014 to be left in the wall to afford ingress and ejjress to the owners. The nest, in either case, is built with many peliets of soft tenacious earth, wrought into form with bits of straw or grass, and afterwards lined with feathers. It is observable that no more work at tlie nest is done in a day than wiU readily harden enough to bear tlie requisite additions of materials abov when the tune comes for making them. There are usually fou five, or six eggs laid; white, speckled and spotted with dee red, and a lighter duller shade, \\u2014 Fig. 20, plate IV. 140. MARIVN\\u2014iHirundo urbica). Martlet, Martin Swallow, House Martin, Window Martin Eaves Swallow, Window Swallow. \\u2014 This familiar little bird whose cheeping note in the nests above our chamber windows i? one of the sounds we should sorely miss, frequents the dwellings of men quite as much as, I think more than, the Swallow. Every one knows where to look for the Martin's nest, and many a house can we all call to mind which seems, from some peculiarity in its site or external fashion, to be particularly affected by these birds \\u2014 and certainly, in most cases, the imnates of the house take much care to save their confiding feathered friends from disturbance. In many places, however, the Martin forms large nesting colonies, which take possession of a series of overhanging ledges on some steep rocky face, and there build their nests in great numbers. In Berwickshire, on the banks of the Whiteadder, I knew of such a colony, and others elsewhere : the principal ones, however, being on the rock-bound coast between St. Abb's Head and Burnmouth. Hundreds of these birds nested in several different places upon those lofty precipices. No description of the nest itself \\u2014 beyond what was said in the notice of the Swallow \\u2014 seems requisite. The number of eggs, which are perfectly Mliite. seems seldom to exceed six. SWIFT. 101 141. SAND MAllTIN\\u2014 (///r\\u00ab\\u00abrfo riparia). Bank Martin, Pit Martin, Sand Swallow, Bank Swallow, River Swallow. \\u2014 This delicate little visitor cornea to us in the spring, often very early, from Africa, as do also the two others of the genus just named. Where it does occur \\u2014 and it is generally diffused \\u2014 it is often seen in very large numbers. A Ballast Pit at Fingringhoe, in Essex, is occupied by the most numerous colony I am acquainted with; and a site afforded by the surface beds of sand and sod above a steep scarp of rock on Tweed-bank, nearly opposite Norham Castle, used to accommodate another colony. Some of the holes are bored to a very great depth. I have enlarged the orifice of many tiU it would admit my whole shoulder, and liave tlien been unable to reach the termination of the gallery. Others are much shorter, and admitting of more easy access to the nest The female -will, notwithstanding the noise and violence attending the enlargement of the aperture of her nest-hole, sit resolutely on, and allow herself to be taken in the hand with scarcely a struggle or sign of resistance \\u2014 even of life, sometimes. One I took thus a year or two since lay in my open hand for a minute or more, and then at last flew only leisurely away. A little loose, soft straw, with some feathers, serves to receive tlie eggs, which are four to six in number, often much elongated in shape, of the most delicate white, and beautifully pink, from the thinness of the shell, before they are blown. 142.

It is most frequently seen at no great distance from some old tower of castle or church, or such like building, although at times it seems to range far in searcli of food. It makes its nest of pieces of soft straw, bents or grass or hay and feathers, and usually in holes in the buildings aforesaid, or between the tiles and underroof of houses ; and the nest once made is supposed to be used for many years in succession by the same pair of birds. It sometimes seems as if it had been cemented together in some way. The Swift often lays only two eggs, but has been known to produce three, and even four. They are quite white, and rather large for the size of the bird. 144. ALPINE SWlYT\\u2014iC^pselus Alpinus).

Night Hawk, Goat-sucker, Dor Hawk, Fern Owl, Night Crow, Jar Owl, Churn Owl, Wheel-bird, Eve-churr, Night-churr, Puckeridge. \\u2014 Far more familiar to many of the comparatively few among country-dwellers who notice such matters, is the Nightjar by sound than by sight. Coming from its retirement but very little and very reluctantly by day, and only pursuing its prey towards and during twilight, it is not by any means an obtnisive bird ; as little so, indeed, as any one of the Owls. But its loud churring or jarring note, as it wheels round a tree or clump of trees, is often enough heard by many a one to whom its form and size and plumage are nearly or utterly strange. It is. perhaps, most frequently met with where patches of furze and aiXQ DOVB 103 fern on open commons, not too far from the neighbourhood of plantations, occur. The Night-jar can hardly be said to make a nest ; but hiys two eggs in any slight natural depression of the ground whicli slie can find suiBciently near a bush or clump of whins to be at least partly concealed by it. Tlie eggs are very oval in shape, and very beautifully mottled and clouded and veined with varying tints of blueish iead-colour and browr\\\\, on a whitish ground. \\u2014 Fig. I, plate VI.

Wood Pigeon, Ring Pigeon, Cushat, Cusliie Doo, Queest. \\u2014 This, the first bird in the new Order of Rasores, is tolerably well known to every one the least acquainted with ordinary country scenes and objects. A fine, handsome bird, met with everywhere throughout the country, and, in many parts of it, seen in very large flocks in the winter time ; sure to attract attention, also, as \\\"we walk through the wood, by the loud ringing clap of his wings as he takes flight ; and all this independently of his plaintive nim-mur in the breeding season, soundmg very sweet and mellow as heard from a little distance \\u2014 the Wood Pigeon, or Queest, or Cushat, as he is named in different districts, is as prominent among wiM birds as the parson of the parish among his parishioners. The young birds are frequently taken from the nest and reared by hand ; and the bold, fearless, confiding familiarity of such pets, considering their extreme native shyness and wildness, is remarkable. The Ring Dove makes its rude platform nest of sticks, with a cushion of roots to receive the eggs 'j\\\\ bushes standing singly or m hedges or woods, in pollard trees, in holly or other thick trees, in evergreens in gardens, and tba l04 BRITISH BIRDS, THEIR EGGS AND NESTS. like ; and nothing is more common than to see the parent birds frequenting the garden and close vicinity of a country-house, aimost as tamely as if they were a pair of common or house Pigeons. The eggs seem to be invariably very oval in shape, and purely wliite. They are 1^ inch long, by | inch broad. 147. STOCK T)OYE\\u2014(Columba anas). Stock Pigeon, Wood Pigeon, Wood Dove. \\u2014 This Dove is not only, generally speaking, much less abundant throughout the country than the Ring Dove, but very often, it would seem, confounded with it by casual observers, who only notice the several birds from a distance, or on the wing. They frequent the same roostiug-places, and often feed in the same field, thougli probably on different species of food. I have shot birds of both species at the same discharge of the gun, and have noticed the different matters which had supplied their meals of the day, \\u2014 Hollyberries, in the case of the Ring Dove ; wild mustard-seed, in the other. The Stock Dove is, however, immediately and easily distinguishable from the Ring Dove, by its lesser size, a slight difference in colour, and the entire absence of the \\\" ring \\\" of white feathers on the neck. Its nest is placed sometimes on pollard trees, sometimes in open holes or hollows in old trees ; and very commonly, in some districts, either on the ground Ijclow tluck furze-bushes, or in deserted rabbit-burrows, two or three feet distant from the entrance. The nest is very slight, consisting merely of a few twigs or roots. The eggs are two in number* pure wliite, about or rather exceeding \\\\\\\\ inch in length, by li inch in breadth. ROCK-DOVE\\u2014 (Co&\\u00bb23a livia). Wild Pigeon, Rock Pigeon, Wild Dove, Doo, Rockier. \\u2014 This Pigeon has usually, until not long since, beec confused with the TURTLE DOVE. 105 Stock Dove. But their plumage is unlike, their voice unlike, and especially their habits and living and breeding haunts unlike. It is believed with some certainty, that the Rock Dove is the reai \\u25a0origin of the Domestic Pigeon, and certainly any one who has -seen the large flight of Domestic Pigeons turned wild, which frequent the caverns in tlie rock-bound coast near St, Abb's Head and similar localities, living with, flying with, feeding with, and nesting with the undoubted wild Rockier, can entertain but very small doubts on the subject. The Ptock Dove makes a loose nest \\u25a0of twigs and plant-stems and dry grass ; very often far back in holes and crevices of the rock ; and lays two white eggs, with a much better defined \\\" big end\\\" and \\\" little end\\\" than in the case of the two Pigeons last named. 149. TURTLE DOYl^\\u2014(Colimba turiur.) Turtle, Common Turtle, Ring-necked Turtle, Wrekin Dove. \\u2014 Only a summer visitor and not a regular inhabitant, like its three predecessors. It is long since, living where I do, I have heard its sweet, plaintive note. No one but one who loves bnds and theii ways can tell how real a deprivation it is to live for years out ol sound of the sweet and familiar voices of such as are only local, the Nightingale for instance, the Turtle, and many others. The male Tnrtle Dove is a very handsome bnd, but much shier and more retiring at breeding-time than the Ring Dove. The nest is a light platform of sticks, easily permitting the sky to be seen through it from below, and usually placed high up in a holly, a thick bush in a wood, in the branches of a fir, or the lesser fork ol some limb of an oak or other forest tree. As with tiie other Doves, the eggs are two in number, quite white, about 1| inch long, by I broad. 150. PASSENGER 71GE0'^\\u2014(Echpisies migratorius). Every bird-loving boy, beyond doubt, has heard of this Pigeon 106 BIUIISH BIRDS, THEIR KGGS AND NESTS, and the inconceivable vastness of the flocks in which they pass from one distant district to another in America.

I dare say \\\"a good few\\\" of our readers if they wers asked \\\" Do you know the Pheasant ?\\\" might answer, \\\" Yes, very well. We had some for dinner, such and such a day.\\\" And I have no doubt the acquaintance was satisfactory enough \\u2014 at least to one of the parties. The Plieasant docs not pair, and on the preserved estates in Norfolk and Cambridgeshire I have frequently seen ia the spring large groups of Cock Pheasants collected and consorting together without the intermixture of a single hen. In a vast many places now an artificial system of Pheasant-breeding is adopted, three or four hens with one male beuig turned into a large paled \\\" apartment,\\\" well netted in, the whole establishment comprising many such apartments. Each hen lays double or treble the number of eggs she would if suffered to run wild, and these are collected daily and placed ujider hens ready to sit as soon as a sufficient number is got together. In this way twice or three times the number of young ones is secured from one hen as compared with her own greatest success in bringing off a brood in the woods. In her w'M state, the Pheasant makes scarcely any nest, on the ground, \\\\uA lays ten or twelve eggs, of a uniform pale olivo-brown shade. Not only are cases in which two Pheasants lay in the same nest of by no means unfrequent occui-rence, but others even, in which Pheasants' eggs have been found in Partridges' nests. Many instances are on record of the Pheasant inter-breeding with other birds, such as the Gumea Fowl, tho BLACK GROUSE. 107 Black Grouse, and the Common Fowl. The cross last named is by no means uncommon, and a remarkably fine male specimen of the produce of a Cock Pheasant and Speckled Hamburg Hen occurred here (one of four birds wiiich were hatched) a few years since. The Pheasant's tail and iiead and general shape as well as fashion of feathers (with access of size) were united to the shades and markings of the plumage of the mother. The bird in question was so inveterate in his visits to the neighbouring farm-yard in order to challenge the Cocks who dwelt there, and so sm-e to kill them outright, or maim or maul them so severely that they had to be kUled, that it became necessary to put him out of the way himself, and his present memorial is liis remarkably well-stuffed skin. \\u2014 Fit/. 2, plate VI.

Now it is becoming comparatively abundant again on the estates of several large and noble owners, principally m Scotland. It is indeed a very noble bird, and well wortliy the care and attention and expense which have been devoted to the attempt to re-establish it. The female makes her nest on the ground, and lays from six to ten or twelve eggs.

In fact, the gradual and very complete demolition of the last remains of what were once very extensive forests has completely banished the Black Grouse from places where it used to be common within the memory of living men. It is a very handsome bird, and like the Capercailly and the Pheasant, does not pair. The hen makes a very slight nest on the ground, and lays in it seven to nine or ten eggs, of a somewhat less warm ground-shade than those last named, but with larger and brighter-coloured spots and blotches. \\u2014 Firj. 4:,plale VI. 154. RED d'KOV^'E\\u2014iLagopns Scoticus.) Red Ptarmigan, Red Game, Moor Game, Muir-fowl, Moorbird. \\u2014 A beautiful bird indeed, and pecuhar to the British Islands. The Grouse moors, however, are mainly confined to the nortliern counties of Eugland and Scotland. In the district in which this is written the Grouse may be truly said to abound, and I iiear them coutinually from my garden or open window.* These birds do pair, and pair very early indeed moreover. I have frequently seen them in pairs before the season for killing them, which expires on December 10, is fully out. If the weather becomes severe this union often seems to be annulled ; but I don't think it is in reality. In tlic earlier spring, when the pairing is becoming general, many fierce battles among the males may be seen going on, and very resolute and lengthened and circuitous flights of one in pursuit of another occur. The nest is very slight, of ling and bents chiefly, and usually well concealed in a tuft of heather. From six or seven up to twelve or fifteen eggs are said to be laid, but I should say that the highest average, judging from the number of young bu-ds in a brood, very rarely * For a detailud series of observations on the liahits, &c., of the Grouse, see \\\" Sketches in Natural Uistory,\\\" Routled^e & Co. COSlMON PARTRIDGE. 109 much exceeds eiglat or nine. The eggs are very beautiful and richly coloured, but vary exceedingly in both ground-colour and markings, even those found in the same nest.

They are of a yellowish groundcolour, blotched and spotted (slightly so as compared with the eggs of the Red Grouse) with ricli dark bro\\\\vn. 156. COMMON PARTRIDGE\\u2014 (Per(//2- chierea). Much too familiar a bird by appearance, voice and flavour to require any very lengthened notice from us. The Partridge pairs pretty early \\u2014 by the end of January, often \\u2014 and once paired they never separate again throughout the season. At pairing time the cocks fight fiercely, and I have sometimes seen, and even m my garden here, three or four engaged in the conflict, with another, probably the female \\\" apple of discord,\\\" sitting quietly by the while. I have seen the male, too, in the evening, when summoning Ms newly-married wife, stand on the top of one of our stone walls and call repeatedly. The nest is made on the ground in a field of grass or corn, or on a dry hedge bank, or at the foot of a waU among the long grass, and consists of little but a slight depression in the ground, with a few dead leaves and 110 BRITISH BIRDS, THEIR EGGS AND NESTS, twenty. But it is no uncommon thing for two Partridges to laj in the same nest, and an instance came to my knowledge two oi three years since, in which a Ked-legged Partridge had laid several eggs in a Common Partridge's nest. Wlien two birds lay together thus, the covey sometimes amounts to thirty or tliirty-five birds. I knew one instance of forty, about three years since. The male Partridge is known to help his mate, when the hatch is drawing on, by sitting at her side and covering some of the eggs. \\\"VVlien there are two layings in the same nest, it is an interesting question whether the two hens sit together, or the original owner of the nest is simply assisted by her mate. The young bu'ds are able to run and \\\" fend for themselves\\\" almost as soon as they are hatched. The eggs are of a uniform pale oUvebrown hue. \\u2014 Fig. 6, plate VI. 157. RED-LEGGED PARTRIDGE\\u2014 (P^r^j> rufa). French Partridge, Guernsey Partridge. \\u2014 A much more striking bird in appearance than the Common Partridge, and said also to be a powerful enemy to it. Certainly, in districts where it has been encouraged and preserved, it seems to have prevailed to the comparative exclusion of the indigenous species. It is supposed to have been first introduced about the time of Charles II. For long it seems to have increased and spread but very slowly, but now there are many districts of the south where it is exceedingly abundant. These birds form a slight nest of dry bents and leaves upon the ground, amid some growing crop of grass or com. Instances, however, have been asserted in which the nest was a good deal elevated above the ground, as on the top of a stack. The eggs, very hard-shelled, are from ten to fifteen or sixteen in number, of a cream colour, well spotted with small speckles of reddish or cirmamon bro^vn. \\u2014 Fij. 7, plate VI. GREAT BUSTARD. Ill 158. QUAIL \\u2014 {Coturnix vulgaris). The quail is believed, in some rare instances, to stay with us all the year, but is usually only a summer visitant, not coming in any great numbers. In some countries its migratory hosts are so great that one hundred thousand are said to have been taken in a day. In its appearance, the quail strongly reminds one of the Partridge, and suggests the idea that itself is only a diminutive bird of that species. They do not, however, pair, and tlieir nests are met with in many parts of the kingdom. Two years since it was believed that at least two broods were reared on certain lauds in Moorsholm, in North Yorkshire. A small depression in the ground is made, or found, and loosely lined with bits of grass and dry stalks. Seven to ten, or possibly yet more eggs, are laid, presenting much variety of appearance, but usually of a faint cream-coloured ground, mottled and clouded in some cases with red brown, and in others spotted with dark brown spots, some of considerable size. \\u2014 Fig. 8, 'plate VI, IV.\\u2014 STRUTHIONID^. 159. GREAT BUSTARD\\u2014 (O/w larda). Tills noble bird, once abundant enough on our wide plains and wolds in England, is now, I fear, ahnost extinct among us, as so far as I am aware no very recent* capture of it has been announced. It used, before the gun became so common and sc; fatal to birds of much interest to the ornithologist or others, to be customarily pursued with greyhounds. These birds do not pair, and their nest is said to be a mere natural saucer-shapej' hole in the bare ground. The eggs are seldom more than two, or at most three, in number, and are of an oUve-green ground, \\u2022 Since this was written, one instance has occurred. 112 BRITISH BIRDS, THEIR EGGS AND NESTS. blotched aud spotted with two or three snades of brown, lighter and darker.

Stone Cm-lew, Norfolk Plover, \\\"VVliistling Plover, Stone Plover, Thick -knee. \\u2014 The Stone Curlew is a summer visitor, and strictly a local one. The Is ightingale, for instance, is very much more extensively diffused than the bird just named. It is fouud abundantly enough on the wide sandy plains of Norfolk, and 1 used to hear it very commonly in the fields a few miles to the north-west of Bury St. Edmunds. Besides the counties just named, it is met with in parts of Essex and Kent, in Hampshire, and Cambridgeshire, and two or three others. Its peculiar shrill CTj- or whistle, once heard, is not likely to be forgotten. The female lays two eggs on the bare ground, among white-coated flints and stones. An idea of their ground-colour may be given by the mention of what the painters call stone-coloui-, in pale shades, and this is streaked and spotted, or marbled, with dark brown. \\u2014 Fig. 1, plate VII. 182.* PRATINCOLE\\u2014 (G'/roro/a torqmla). CoUared Pratincole, Austrian Pratincole. \\u2014 A bird of sufficiently rare occurrence in this country, and remarkable as having caused some degree of perplexity and dispute among naturalists as to the position it shoidd occupy in the general system or classiiica- GOLDEN PLOVRR. 1 13 fion of tiie Bird-family. Mr. Yarrell (in whose first edition it appears at the iiead of the Rail-family) says \\u2014 \\\" The Pratincole has been arranged by some authors with the Swallows, by tthcin near the Rails ; but I believe, with ]\\u00bbIr. Selby, that it ought to be included in the family of the Plovers ; and had I kno\\\\\\\\Ti itr. Plover-liie habits and eggs sooner, I should have arranged it between Cursorius and Charadrius.\\\" To this Mr. Hewitson adds \\u2014 \\\" Besides the similarity of then- habits, the fact of this species laying four eggs is a further link to connect it with the Charadi-iidse.\\\" It is, liowever, much too rare \\u2014 besides being known not to breed in Britain \\u2014 to have any claim on our limited space for description of its nest or eggs. 163. GOLDEN ^LOTER\\u2014{Ckaradnus pluvialis). Yellow Plover, Green Plover, Wliistliug Plover. \\u2014 It has sometimes been an object to me to obtain specimens of this bird in its breeding-plumage, and it is scarcely possible to imagine a stronger contrast tlian that presented by the male in lils May di'ess and six or eight months later. All the glossy black of neck and breast has entirely disappeared long before the latter period. I have occasionally seen a single pair or two, very early in the year, separating themselves from the great flock of some scores ; and in the female of one such pair which I shot some few years since (the next shot killing five out of a very large flock at no great distance), I found an egg quite ready for extrusion, and which from the depth of its colourhig, would probably have been laid in the course of a few hours at most. The hen-bird makes a very slight nest, and lays just four eggs in it, seldom either more or less. They are of a large size for the bird, of a fair stone-colour, well blotched and spotted with very dark or blackish brown. After sitting eight or ten days the bird becomes very reluctant to leave her nest, and will suffer herself to be almost I 114 BRITISH BIRDS, THEIR EGGS AND NESTS. trodden on rather. The young ones, awkward-looking motlied yellow and brown puff-balls on stilts, run fast and well soon after they are batched, and do not speedily acquire the use of those \\u25a0wings which, after a time, are to be so strong and swift. Very jeaioas too, are the parents as long as their young are only runners, and very plaintive is their incessant piping if you or your dog approach too near their place of concealment. \\u2014 \\u00a5ig. 2, plate VII. 164. DOTT'E.ViEL\\u2014iCharadnus mormellus). Dottrel or Dotterel Plover, Foolish Dottrel. \\u2014 This is a summer visitor to our country, and in many localities where it used to be abundant, or at least common, it is now rare or almost unknown. This is the case on parts at least of the Yorkshire Wolds, as well as in the Lake district. They are sought after by the Fly-fisher and by the Ornithologist and by the Epicure, and from their exceedingly simple and unsuspicious habits they fall easy victims before the fowlhig-piece of modern days. The female makes no nest, but lays her customary three eggs in a slight cavity on the ground near high mountain tops, where some tall-growing moss or other mountain herbage facilitates concealment. The eggs are of an olivaceous hue, spotted plentifully with very dark brown or brownish-blacK. 165. RINGED PLOVER\\u2014 (C/^^ra^/rzz^s Uuticula). Ringed or Ring Dottrel. \\u2014 A very pretty shore-bird, of interesting habits, and not infrequent, especially in winter, on many parts of the British coast. In quiet parts, whore large expanses of sand or shingle, or even mud, are left by the receding tide, it may be seen in numbers. It seems to make no nest : \\u2014 the eggs are laid on the sand, and often at a very considerable distance from the sea ; as, for instance, on the warrens in Norfolk and Suffolk, They are four in number, very large in proportion to 115 the s:z3 of the bird, possessing the 2;cculiar pointcLl shape of tlie eggs of the entire class of birds we are now among, and of a warm cream-colour, spotted and streaked with black. The parent birds try hard to lead the casual intruder away from the vicinity of their young. \\u2014 Jig. 3, plate VII. IGG. KENTISH PLOVER\\u2014 (a^/r\\u00abf/r/\\u00ab.? Cmdianus). Seldom obtained vei-y far from the southern coasts of England, and not appearing to be a very plentiful bird e\\\\'en there. In liabits, it strongly resembles the Ring Plover just named. The female makes no nest, but lays her four eggs in a slight hollow on sand or shingle, which strongly resemble some of the lightercoloured examples of the eggs of the last-named species. \\u2014 Fig. 4, plate VII. 1G7. LITTLE RINGED V\\\\jO^^YK\\u2014{Charadrius minor). A very rare British Bird. 16S. GREY VLOTEK\\u2014iSquatarola cinerea). A bird which has never been ascertained to breed in England, although specimens in the dark-breasted ]\\\\Iay plumage have been seen in the London Markets, and observed by Mr. Selby in the Fame Islands, in June. It is not uncommon as a winter visitor, lliough even then nothing like so numerous as the Golden Plover in its winter visits to districts in which it does not breed. The eggs are said to be in colour \\\" oil green, spotted with different shades of umber brown ; the spots, crowded and confluent round the obtuse end.\\\" 16D. LAP'vVING \\u2014 iVanellua cmtaius). ' I'ewit or Peewit, Te-wit, Teu-fit, Green Piover, Bastard Plover, Green Lapwing, Crested Lapwing. \\u2014 Anotiier of thosa bircib whiuh are familiar to almost everyone who is not a mere casual visitor to the country, or quite deaf and bUnd to its commonest sounds and sights. It is a very universally diflfused 116 BRITISH BIRDS, TIIEIK EGGS AND NBSTS. bird, even in those districts where it docs not statedly breed. It nests not only on commons and heaths and the wide moor, but in the fields and inclosures; and round my present residence 1 have many yearly evidences that there are half-a-dozen nests within tlie linuts of a sliort lialf-mile wliich intervenes between me and thfc moors. The female constructs scarcely any nest, properly so called, but makes or more likely avails herself of a ready-made slight cavity on the siu'face of the ground, with a sufficiency of some kind of herbage to serve as covert. The female's habits in tonnection with the nest and eggs are different from the male's. She slips off on the approach of a visitor, aud runs very silently and quietly away to some distance before taking wing ; he hastens up on rapid, sounding, whirling wing, and cries and dashes and wheels above and around the cause of alarm in a very remarkable manner. The Peewit lays four eggs, of large size and acutely pointed at the lesser end, and like so many others of the class, often arranged so as to occupy the least possible space, by having their pomts all turned inward. They are of a darkish olive-dun ground, abundantly blotched and spotted with brown and black. These eggs are much sought after as delicacies for the table. They are boiled hard and served cold, and when tlie shell is removed they have quite a jelly-like appearance. But very few of the eggs, however, sold in the market as \\\" Plovers'- eggs,\\\" are sometimes recognised by the oologist as having been laid by tlie Lapv/ing. \\u2014 Tig. 5, jilate VI L 170. TURxN STONE\\u2014 (5/re/j5i7aj tnferpres). Hebridal Sandpiper. \\u2014 Found on many parts of our coast either in small parties, or one or two together, from September aJl through the winter. In the spring it leaves us to go to tlie north for breeding objects, but has never been recognised aa OYSTER-CATCUEll. 117 nesting within the limits of the British Islands, We cannot therefore notice its nest and eggs in this place. 171.

Common Sanderling, Sanderling Plover. \\u2014 Like the bird last named, a by no means unusual visitant to most parts of our coasts, and sometimes met with also at tlie edge of large pieces of fresh water, but never known hitherto to have bred with us. It is found associating most commonly, though in small parties for the most part, with the Dunlin, and other similar shorehaunting bii'ds. 172. OYSTER-CATCHER\\u2014 (Zr\\u00ab\\u00aba/o;)\\u00ab5 ostntlegm). Pied Oyster-catcher, Shelder, Sea-Pie, Olive. \\u2014 A very beautiful and well-known dweller on our sea-coasts, and wonderfully provided by nature, too, with a suitable instrument for purveying its destined food. The bill of the Oyster-catcher is one of those natural objects which form each a study in themselves. Woe be to the oyster or mussel, however powerful its mechanism for closing its valves, if once the Oyster-catcher has found means to insert that natural weapon of his. Flattened sideways, and hard and strong as so much bone, its eiEcacy is so great that there can be scarcely a struggle for life on the part of the shell-fish. It runs well, and is even said to dive and swim with facility. I never saw this, though I have had them mider my observation for hours together in fonncr days. But I know their shrill, rattling whistle, and their short uneasy (lights, and restless paddlings up and doMTi upon the ooze, wlien I liave been among their haunts, well \\u2014 and marry a nest it used to be my lot to discover on some parts of some of the Essex Saltings.

III.\\u2014 ARDEID^. 174. COMMON W^VSm\\u2014{Ardea cinerea). Hern, Heronshaw, Heronseugh. \\u2014 It would have been no light matter once to have molested a Heron. Those birds were \\\" preserved\\\" with a strictness we scarcely can imagine even in these days of game-preserves. They were the peculiar game of royal and noble personages. Now, however, the case is widely different, and probably not one Heron in a himdred can now be met with as compared with the days of falconry. It is a strange odd sight to sec a Heron balancing himself on the topmost twig of some fir-tree, and succeeding after a few uneasy motions of body and wings in poising himself. The Heron sometimes breeds on precipitous rocks, but much more commonly on trees, \\u2014 generally trees of large size, and commonly oaks or firs. It is not a solitary builder, but Kke the Hook forms a community, and frequents the same tree or clump of trees tlircugh successive years for many generations. Each nest is of large size, and composed of sticks with a lining of wool. Four or five eggs are usually deposited, of an uniform pale green colour. A few nests ai-e said to hare been met with on the ground. \\u2014 Fiq. 1, ylate VIII. LITTLE BITTEKN. 175. PURPLE KERO'^\\u2014iJrdea purpurea).

There was one about the moors in this district four or five years since, which I saw myself and heard of as seen in the same neighbourhood by others ; and about the same tune J noticed that birds of the same species had been observed io several other parts of Yorksliire, and elsewhere.

A\\\\niaup. \\u2014 As common a bii'd as almost any along the whole of the British coasts. Sometimes smgly and sometimes in groups of eight or ten, it may be seen along the line of oozy shores or the sandy Qats which are laid bare by the receding tide. When the water is sufficiently high to cover all its feeding grounds, it betakes itself to some higher groiuid in the vicinity, to rest during those hours of inactivity in food-search. When removing from one place, or part of the coast, to another, it usually flics in long lines, which liowevcr scarcely maintain the same degree of accuracy as in the case of Wild Geese or other line-flying wild fowl. On the arrival of spring the Curlews leave the coast and retire to their breeding niunts iu the hills of the extreme north of England, the highest 15i2 BIUTISI! liiRL'S, TUEIK liGCiS AND NESTS. moorlands of Scotland, and other similar places in more norther!^ latitudes yet. Its note once heard is sufficiently noticeable to be easily recognised on any future occasion. It makes a very careless or rude nest, and lays four eggs which vary a good deal in the depth of the ground-colour and the amount of their spots. It is pale greenish dun, varying to olive-green, and spotted with darker shades of green and dark-brown. \\u2014 Fig. 3, jilate VIII. 190. ^\\\\lllls^>>\\\\l'EL\\u2014{Numenius phceopus). Wliimbrel-Curlew, Curlew-Jack, Curlew-Knot, Half-Curlew, Jack-Curlew, Stone Curlew, Tang-Whaap. \\u2014 No wonder it haa the name of Half-Curlew, for it does most strongly resemble a diminutive Curlew in its plumage, shape, fashion of bill, haunts, and many of its habits. It is seen, in no great numbers, on many of our coasts in winter ; nut I have met with it on the Essex Saltings only in the early spring and previous to its retirement to the north to breed. It is difficult to assert positively that it frequents any part of the main British Island for that purpose ; but it is known to nest in both Orkney and Shetland. The nest is said by Dr. Fleming to be placed in exposed parts of a moor. The eggs are four in number, and, though very much less in size very much like the darker varieties of the Curlew's eggs. The Whimbrcl is probably a fast decreasing species. 191. SPOTTED RED-SHANK\\u2014 (To^tf\\u00ab?\\u00ab/\\u00ab5r?\\u00ab').

Many ''>ng days have I spent amid their haunts on the Essex Saltings. Their nests are very slightly constructed of a few bits of grass amidst a tuft of herbage, or in a small hole or cavity which is sheltered by some cf the taller-growing marine plants. The eggs are usually :'our in number, occasionally but two or three, of a cream-colcur (sometimes daslicd with a somewhat warmer hue) spotted and speckled with dark brown. The spots are less and more numerous than in the case of the Peewit's egg. Tn the case of the last nest I foimd, about two years since, the old bird suffered me to walk within a yard of her before taking flight. \\\"WTien the young are newly hatched the parent birds betray excessive jealousy and anxiety at the approach of either man or dog to their resort. They liave sometimes come and settled on the ground within two or three paces of mc, and, at others, flown so directly towards me, as to suggest tlie possible intention of attacking mc, piping most plaintively and incessantly tlie wliile. This conduct is designated by the term \\\" mobbing,\\\" on the Essex marshes. Fi^. 4, plale VIII. ]93. GREEN ^\\\\lsT)-V\\\\Vn{.\\u2014{Tof anus och opus). It is supposed that a few of these birds may remain with us to breed ; but far the greater part of those which are customarily seen about the sides of our smaller streams and ditches and canals, are kno^vn to retui-n far to the north to produce their eggs and young. I believe no authenticated instances of its nesting with us are known, but a few very young birds have been met with under circumstances which seemed to leave no doubt that tliey must have been hatched in the neighbourhood.

It is not by any means a frequently occurring visitor, though it seems to be admitted that it is more than probable it sometimes breeds in this country. Mr. Hoy's account of its habits and nesting peculiarities, as observed by himself in Dutch Brabant, is quoted at length by both Mr. Yarrell and Mr. Ilewitson. He says, \\\" The nest is generally placed at a short distance from the water, among stunted heath, or scrubby plants of the Bog Myrtle, or among coarse grass and rushes. It is placed in. a hollow, and formed of dry grass and other plants.

Unlike the Dipper, wliich may constantly be seen sitting quite still near the edge of the stream, the Summer Snipe is always in motion. It makes a very rude nest of dry grass in some hole in a bank not far from water, where the shelter anil concealment of sufhcient herbage is available, and lays in it four eggs, which vary often in colour and spots but are usually of a ytUowish-white, with blotches and spots of deep brown or ordinary brown.

The nest is said to be like that of the Golden Plover or Lapwing, consisting only of a few blades of grass or sprigs of ling, placed in a hollow in the soil. The eggs\\u2014 like so very many of those characterised by the pyriform shape peculiar to the Grallatores \\u2014 are placed with their pointed ends together in the middle, and are of a pale yellowish-green colour, spotted all over irregularly with dark brown with intermingled blotches of light pui-plish-grey ; the spots and blotches being more nuinerous at the larger end. 198. KNQCWi:\\u2014{Recurvirostra avocstta). Butterflip, Scooper, Yelper, Cobbler's Awl, Crooked-bill, Cobbler's-Awl Duck. \\u2014 Fast verging on extinction. In Sir Thomas Browne's time it was not at all uncommon ; but of late years but seldom recorded as having been \\\" obtained,\\\" or met with. If only people weren't so fond of \\\"obtaining\\\" our rare birds. But now-a-days, when every third person has a gun, the appearance of a \\\"rare bird\\\" is enough to set half a village off in pursuit, and the great object of hundreds throughout the country seems just to be to destroy the casual feathered visitor, howcvei interesting it may be or whatever claims it might seem to possess on our hospitality. The Avocet's bill and plumage are enough to point it out for slaughter, and so, slaughtered it has beefi.. It used to breed in Sussex and Norfolk. \\\" The nest is said to be a small liole in the drier parts of extensive marshes.

BLACK-TAILED GODWIT\\u2014 (Z/wo.srt melanum). Red-Godwit Snipe, Jadreka Snipe, Red Godwit, Yarwhelp, Yarwhip, Shricker. \\u2014 Another of tliose birds which two or three generations back were exceedingly more abundant than now: proportionately esteemed, too, as an article of delicate fare in the days of its frefjuency, now little heard of, or perhaps thought of. But our forefathers tliought many things of the eatable sort good, which their descendants of ISGl had rather not sit down to. I rather tliink my young readers might not eat Poi-poise or Heron either, with any great relish, not to speak of other matter* about equally, or more questionably, \\\" good eating.\\\" Both this species of Godwit and the one to be mentioned next are subject, like the Golden Plover, the Gray Plover, the Spotted Redshank, aad many others yet to be named, to very great and striking changes of plumage in the breeding season. At all times they are handsome birds. Tiie Black-Tailed Godwit is believed stUl to breed, however rarely, in England \\u2014 in Norfolk and Cambridgeshire, in fact. The nest Is found in marshy places, made of dry grass and the like, and more or less concealed by the coarse i,'rowths peculiar to such places. The eggs vary in both size a:i.^. colours, but are usually of a greenish oiive-browTi, marbled and KUFF. 127 blotched with darker brown ; and, as usual in this class of birds, are generally four in iiuinber. 201.

Common Godwit, Grey Godwit, Hcd Godwii, Godwit Snipe, Red-breasted Snipe. \\u2014 Of much the same habits ay the last, only not remaining in this country to breed, and consequently occur ring much more frequently in winter than in spring, and uot at all in summer. As not nesting with us, no space can be conceded here for a notice of its eggs and nest. 202. W^m\\u2014{JSlachetes pugnax). Female, Reeve. \\u2014 Time was, and not so very long ago cither, when one fenman could take six dozen of these Ijirds in a suigle day. Now, I fear, be woidd scarcely get that number in an entire season. The Ruff is, however, stiU. known to breed annually in some of the fens of Lincolnshire and Cambridgeshire. The variety of plumage, no less than the very remarkable ruff or feathery appendage about the neck of the male in the breeding season, is quite sufficient to make this a very conspicuous bird among our truly native birds. Scarcely any two males in an assemblage of some dozens can, in some cases, be picked out as possessing exactly the same plumage. The breeding habits, or some of them, observed in this bird are also very characteristic. His Latin name, as given above, simply meats \\\"pugnacious warrior,\\\" and verily he is as thorough a lover of battle as any knight-errant of the middle ages, or fierce Northern sea-rover of four or five centuries earlier. They do not pair, and therefore fight for the possessioji of the females, and they have spots, known to the fenmen by the name of Hills, which are as much the scenes of universal challenge and battle as ever the stated \\\"lists\\\" of the old days of tournament or playing at battle. This habit of theirs faciUtates the process of capture vcrj 128 lUUTISII BIKDS, THEIR EGGS AND HESTS. materially, and by means of a peculiar kind of not, duly arranged before the day begins to dawn, the fowler is enabled to capture all, or almost all, who have been attracted by their peculiar instmcts to the vicinity of any given hill. The Reeves lay each her four eggs, which vary in colour from olive-green to a yellowish stone colour, and are spotted and blotched with \\\"liver colour\\\" and rich brown. 203. WOOD-COCK\\u2014 {Scolopax rudicola). One of our most universally recognised \\\"birds of passage,\\\" coming to us sometimes in the autumn (always, at least, beginning to arrive in October), and leaving us again in the spring ; still no season passes, there is reason to believe, in which many pairs do not remain to breed, and that too in many different parts of the kingdom. It was an object to me some twenty years ago to obtain eggs of the Woodcock, and I applied to a person in Norfolk, who had not any difficulty in procuring for me eggs from the gamekeeper of a neighboui'ing estate out o( two different nests which had been deserted by their owners. My friend added the information, that scarcely a year passed in which one nest or more of Woodcocks was not known of on the estate in question. The nest, a very loose one, is made of deaa leaves and the like. Bracken leaves appearing to be commonly used for the purpose. The eggs are usually about four in number, and want the peculiar pointed shape common to almost all the other birds of the Order. They are of a dirty yellowishwhite, a good deal blotched and spotted with two or three shades of pale brown and purplish-grey. The old bird is known to transport her young, if occasion demands, from one place to another. She has been seen doing so repeatedly, and by good observers, generally making use of both feet for the purpose, sometimes one only ; and, it is said, using her beak sometimes foi the same purpose. \\u2014 Fig. 1, plate IX. <;OM.MON SNll'E. 121 20i. GREAL' SmV'E\\u2014iSco.'.ofa.vmajoi). Solitary Snipe, Double Suipe. \\u2014 Often taken, no doubt, by many a sportsman in former days to be a very large specimen o the Common Snipe, than which no bird with wliieh I am well acquainted seems to vary more in si;5C. On the wing it does not look much larger than the Common Snipe, and is seldom seen except alone, or at most two in company. It breeds in higli northern localities, and never with us, and no notice, therefore, of its nesting habits is permissible in this place. 205. COMMON SmVE\\u2014iScolopax ffallimf/o). Whole Snipe, Snite, Heather-bleatcr. \\u2014 Although this Snipe, like the Woodcock, retires to northern latitudes to breed, yet there are few districts in Britain suitable to its habits in wliich it is not known to breed in greater or less numbers. And it is a bird, moreover, which is quite sure to make it very distinctly known that it has a nest and eggs somewhere near, if only any human visitor appears on the scene. I refer to the very peculiar note or sound emitted Ijy the male, always while he is on the wing high in the air, and always accompanied with a very remarkable action of his wings and curving descent iu his flight. This sound or note \\u2014 for it is not absolutely certain, I think, how it is produced \\u2014 is variously called humming, bleating, drumming, buzzing. To me, the first time I heard it, and before I knew to wnat origin to assign it, the impression produced was precisely that of a large Bee, entangled in some particular place and unable to extricate itself ; and I remem.ber spending some minutes in trying to discover the supposed insect. The eggs are usually four, placed in a very sh'ght and inartificial nest on the ground near some tuft of rushes or other water-herbage. They are of a greenish-olive hue, blotched and spotted with two or three shades of brown, the deepest being very dark. The old ones are said to K 139 BRITISH BIRDS, THEIR EGGS AND NKSTS. be very jealous and careful of their young. Many couple are often killed on the moors in this district on or just after the 12th of August. \\u2014 Fig. 2, flate IX. 206. JACK ^\\\"^IV^\\u2014iScobpax galUnuIa). Judcock, Half Snipe. \\u2014 A little bird, very often seen quite late in the spring, but no specimen of whose e^^ undoubtedly laid in Britain has, as far as I know, ever yet been produced. It mai/ breed here, in some few instances, but none such are yet ascertained. No notice of its eggs can consequently be inserted here. 207. SABINE'S ^'^l'?'E.-\\u2014{Scolopa.T Sabini). A very few instances indeed have been recorded of the occurrence of this bird in England. 208. BROWN ^'El?'E.\\u2014{3Iacroramphus griseus). As rare a bird as that last named, or nearly so. 209. CURLEW SAND-PIPER\\u2014 (r^/^a subarquata) This little bird, which serves to connect the true Snipes with the sea-frequenting Snipes, or Sandpipers, was till lately considered to be a very rare and occasional visitor. But it is very likely to have been confused with the Dunlin, or other small shore-birds, and is now supposed even to breed occasionally in our country. During autumn it is sometimes seen in small groups or flocks. \\\" M. Temminck says this bird breeds occasionally in Holland, and that the eggs are yellowish-white, spotted with dark brown.\\\" 210. KNOT.\\u2014 (rr%a Caimtus). Camden says this bird derived its name from the Danish King Knut or Cnut, (generally written Canute, but not properly Tsrouounced so ;) probably because he was very fond of eating *aera. A very poor piece of etymology I should almost think. It is not uncommonly met with in autumn on several parts of our coasts, and as far as I have seen is by no means dilficult to DUNLIN. 131 approach. Bat its breeding-place is very much more to the north than any portion of the British Islands extends. The male in his nuptial dress is a very much gayer gentleman than after his annual honeymoon is over. 211. BUFF-BREASTED SAND-?irER~(rr%o rvfescetii). Only of very casual occurrence here. 212. BROAD-BILLED ^mD-?l\\\\^^Vi\\u2014{Tringaplal>/rhpica]. Fully as rare as the last. 132. LITTLE ^Tl^ll\\u2014{Tringa minufa Not to be described altogether as a rare little bird, for it seems to be met with sometimes in autumn ou the Southern and Eastern coasts in some numbers, and even in flocks of twenty or thirty together. They are often seen in company with the Dunlin or other small shore-bu'ds. Very little is known about their breeding places or habits. 2U. TEMMINCK'S STINT\\u2014 (r/7\\u00abya Temmiuckii). Less even than the last named small bird, and mucli more rare ; besides which it frequents fresh waters rather than the sea-shore. No very great number of them, however, has been met with in England. 214*. SCHINZ'S SAND-PIPER\\u2014 (7'r\\u00ab\\u00ab^a ScJdnzii). A very rare bird. 215. PECTORAL SAND-PIPER\\u2014 (r;-?/;^/^ isec^ora/w). Another rare Sandpiper ; and, like the last, a native of America. 216. DUNLIN\\u2014 (rr%a variabilis). D unlin Sandpiper, PuiTC, Churr, Stint, Oxbird, Sea Snipe, Least Snipe, Sea Lark. \\u2014 Perhaps the very commonest and best known, as well as incomparably the most abundant of all our small shore bii'ds, and yet the one about which heaps of scientific mistakes have been made. The male has a conspicuous weddingdress, which he duly puts on in the Spring, and once it was on R 2 132 BlllTISII BIKDS, THEIR EGGS AND KESTS. he was ciiristened Tringa Alpina, tlie DuiJin. Then in the autiunn and winter, having divested himself alike of his summer dress and alJ properly or concern in wife and children, he wa? named anew Tringa Cinclus, the Purre. On its behig satisfactorily ascertained that the only real difference between Dunlin and Purre was that of a few feathers, and those cliiefly on the breast, and dependent simply on Season, the new name at the head of this notice was suggested and willingly adopted as altogettier a fit one. The Dunlin, always called Oxbird where my boyhood was spent, and often seen there in flocks of not simply hundi'cds, but thousands, and many thousands, in the autumn and winter, goes to the far north to breed, though some of their hosts stay in the north of Scotland, the Hebrides, Orkneys and other Islands near. Their nests are placed on the ground, among long grass and ling, and always contain four eggs. Mr. Hewitson says : \\u2014 \\\" In beauty of colouring and elegance of form the eggs of the Dunlin are unrivalled. The groundcolour is sometimes of a clear light green, richly spotted with, light brown ; sometimes the ground-colour is of a bluish-white.\\\"' The hen will suffer herseK to be removed from her nest by the naud rather than leave her eggs. \\u2014 Ylg. 3, plate IX. 217. PURPLE SAND-PIPER\\u2014 (rm^a marithnd). Sebiinger Sand-piper, Black Sand-piper. \\u2014 Not a very numerous species, but by no means infrequent on the British coasts. Very few, however, are seen except in winter and early spring, the far greater part resorting to some place far in the north to nest. Still it seems almost certain that a few breed \\\\nsh us in North England and Scotland. It lays four eggs of \\\"a yellowish-grey colour, varied with small irregular spots of pale brown, thick at the obtuse end, rarer at the other.\\\" LAND- KAIL. 133 v.\\u2014 EALLID^. 218. LAND-RAIL\\u2014 (Ci-e.r pratensis). Corn Crake, Meadow Crake, Dakerhen. \\u2014 This bird is found in most parts of tlie kingdom, though for the most part in no great abundance any where, in the earlier months of the autumn. In most of the northern parts it breeds annually, but I clo not remember ever hearmg its breeding note while I was a dweller in the district embracing what are usually called the Eastern Counties. Nor yet in Herefordshire. But the note in question has been sufficiently familiar to me for the last twenty years, and here in North Yorkshire I hear it on all sides of me, at all hours, I may say, of day and night. For two or three years in succession a pair took possession of a small plantation of young fir trees bordering my garden lawn on the north, and only separated from it by a deep ditch with a run of water at the bottom. Long after the union seemed to have been formed the pecidiar note was kept up, and I used to see both birds within a few feet of each other during its continuance. Scarcely a day passed during their sojourn of eight or ten days in and about the plantation, but excursions were taken into the garden, frequently extending to the terrace beneath my dining-room window, where sundry very inquirnig and mterested glances \\u2014 not to say stares \\u2014 were exchanged between the visitors and myself and divers members of my family. The visitors seemed very little disturbed at our notice as long as we remained quite still and silent, but any movement on our part led to immediate retreat on the Corn Crake's. Its movements were desultory or in jerks, so to Bpeak. The bird would run ten or twelve paces in an attitude and with a speed which left one in doubt for a moment whether it were not some small quadruped. Tiien it would 134 BRITISH BIRDS, TUEIR EGGS AND >'ESTS, skulk amid taller herbage, or under tlie slirubs of a raised bed, m beneath a rhododendron bush. A minute after it would be seea with its head and whole body erect, and the neck so out-stretched that if the bird had been hung up by its head it could not have been much more elongated. This was the invariable position or attitude assumed when interchanging looks with tlie occupants of the window. My own impression was that these journeys or excui-sions (which I knew extended into the grass-Held beyond the garden, and into a field over the road at the back of tlie plantation) were simply made for the purpose of inspection, and with a view to the selection of a place for nesting \\u2014 and tliat, pending this interesting investigation, the fir trees and herbage baucatli afforded an ample covert. As far as I could ascertain, the place actually selected by them for the purpose was in the field \\u2014 a corn-field \\u2014 just beyond that which lay adjacent to the garden. The Corn Crake makes a loose nest of dry herbage and stalks and grass ; and I think almost always among growing herbage \\u2014 grass, clover, or corn. The hen lays seven or eight eggs, sometimes even ten, and sits very close upon them. They are whitish in ground, suffused with a reddish tinge, and spotted and speckled with brownish-red and purplish-grey . \\u2014 Fig. 4, phi{e IX. 219. SrOTTED CRk'K'E\\u2014{Crex j^orzana). A summer visitor, as the Land Rail is, to our shores. It is rare, however, compared with the Land Rail, and with more predilection for the vicinity of water. Like all tlie other Rails it conceals itself very closely, and from the form of its body and power of leg runs with great speed and equal facility, even among what seems to be and is very thick covert. It is knowai to breed m Norfolk and in Cambridgeshire, and is believed to do 40 in other localities as well. The nest, made on the ground i\\u00bb WATEK-RAIL. 105 wet marshes, is \\\"formed on the outside,\\\" says Mr. Yarrell, \\\" with coarse aquatic plants, lined witii finer materials within.\\\" From seven to ten eggs appears to be the number laid, and they vary very much in their ground-colour, between a pale brownishdun and a slightly yellow-white, the spots or blotches being of a reddish brown of some intensity. \\u2014 Fig. 5, plate IX. 220. LITTLE Q,RKKE\\u2014{Crex pusilla). Olivaceous Gallinule, Little Gallinule. \\u2014 Strictly speaking, still a rare bird in this country. 221. BAILLON'S CRAKE\\u2014 (<7/-^.r BaiUonii). More rare than the last, and, perhaps, occasionally confused with it. 222. WATER V.kTL\\u2014{Ralliis aquaticus). Bilcock, Skiddycock, Runner, Brook-runner, Velvet-runner. \\u2014 One of the very shiest of our British birds, and thus seeming to be much more rare tlian it really is. I have seen it at a 1 seasons of the year, though it is, I am weU aware, less tolerant of cold than many other of our winter-stay mg birds. Its motions on the bank of a stream, when suddenly disturbed, are much more like those of a Water Rat than a bird. It breeds with some degree of commonness in several of the Southern counties. I obtained two nests from the estate in Norfolk, already mentioned in these pages, at the same time with the Woodcock's eggs, and was informed that it bred regularly there. I had reason also to know that it bred at ToUeshunt D'Arcv, in Essex. The nest is made often in an osier ground or among thick water plants, and composed of different kinds of aquatic herbage. The eggs are from six to nine or ten in number, and seldom quite white mhue; usually they are much more like pale or faded specimens of the Land Rail's eggs, the spots being both fewer and fainter. \\u2014 Fig. ht plate IX, J36 BITISU BUIDS, THElll EGGS A.NH KtSlS. 223. MOOR ilES\\u2014{Gallinula cJiloropus). Water Hen, Gallinule, Moat Hen, Marsh Hen.\\u2014 Few nesthiuaters, liowcver young, hut know the nest and eggs of this very common bird. I have in many cases seen it almost domesticated, and constantly taking its food among domestic fowls, and sometimes even almost from the hands of human creatm-es. Its nest is made in somewhat various places. I have seen it amid the sedges growing in the water near the edge of a marsh-ditch or the like, on di-y tussocky tumps near a sheet of water, among ^he herbage and wiUow stubs not far from the same Mere, built upon masses of fallen but not decayed buh-ushes and flags, at the edge of a pond, on a bough projecting several feet horizontally from the bank over and resting upon (or partly in) the water of a running stream, nay, even in a branch or top of a thick tree, or among the ivy which mantled its trunk and wreathed its branches. In it are laid six, seven, or eight eggs, of a reddish-white colour, sparingly speckled and spotted with reddish-brown. The eggs have been known to be removed by the parent birds under circumstances of perd awaiting them \\u2014 from a flood for instance \\u2014 and hatched in some new locality. Instances also have been recorded in which a supplementary nest has been constructed by the female parent to receive a part of her brood, when they were too numeious mid had grown too large to be accommodated by their original nest-home at night. \\u2014 Fiff. 7, plate IX. VI.\\u2014 LOBIPEDIDvE. 224.\\u2014 COOT\\u2014 (i^\\u00ab//f\\u00ab atra). Bald Coot.\\u2014 A common bird enough in many parts of tne kingdom, and, in former days, I have sometunes seen them in straggling flocks of several hundreds or tliousands along the tide- way GKEr-LKGGED GOOSE, 1^7 on the Essex coasts. Witli its white oval spot ou the forehead, and perfectly black plumage, it is a suillcieatly noticeable bird. It seems to be much more at home on the water than on land ; but, like the Moor lien, can and does move with very considerable ease and speed on the latter. The Coot makes a large and very strong and compact nest, makmg or finding a Gxm foundation for it below the surface of tlie water, and heaping up and twisting in dry flags and bukushes and pieces of reed, until some of the nests are sufEcicntly firm and stable to support a considerable weight. The eggs laid are usually seven or eight, and up to ten; though even twelve or fourteen have been mentioned as sometimes found. They are of a dingy stone-colour, speckled and spotted with dark brown. \\u2014 Fi^. 8, p/aie IX. 225. GREY PHALAROPE\\u2014 (P//\\u00ab/\\u00abro;??\\u00ab loba(us). Red Phalarope. \\u2014 Supposed, some half-century since, to be exceedingly rare in this country, but now known to visit our shores in small numbers, perliaps annually, on their way to their winter place of sojourning. Like the Coot, they arc lobe-footed, and very capable swimmers. 226. RED-NECKED niMjrVllO^'E.\\u2014iF/iaiaropus hijpsrhoreus).

A very large proportion of them, moreover, never by any chance breed in any portion of the British Islands, but resort to distant and very northerly localities for that purpose. The first on our list, the Common Grey, or Wild Goose, is an instance in point. It is believed once to have been a regular inhabitant, and to have bred abundantly in the fenny districts which then prevailed over many parts of the kingdom, not at all near or connected with what is yet called \\\" the fen country.\\\" But now it is comparatively a rare bird at any season of the year, and nests no nearer to us than some of the isles and coasts of Scandinavia. 228. BEAN GOOS^\\u2014(Jnser set/e^/m). Like the last, and in common witli the Geese next to be men* tioned, indiscriminately know^l by the name of Wild Goose. Unlike the last, however, it is ascertained to breed in small numbers on some of the large lakes in the north of Scotland, and iu the islands of Ijf^wis and Harris. Besides which, a nesting locality of this species in Westmoreland is named. The nests, iu some instances, are hid in very tall ling, and the eggs are from five to seven in number. In size they are a little under 3| inches long by 2^ broad. 229. PINK-rOOTED GOOSI.\\u2014(Jnser hrachyrhyncus). A smaller bird than the last, but otherwise bearing a veiy strolls' resemblance to it ; so much so, that it appears more than probable it has often been assumed to be a young or small specimen of the former species. It is, however, of compai'atively raro occurrence notwithstanding. BRENT GOOSE. 1S9 230. WHITE-FRONTED GOOSE\\u2014 (^\\u00ab.?ca alblfrons). Laughing Goose. \\u2014 A regular winter visitor, and not in any very scanty numbers. One of my very worst discomfitures in my early sporting-days took place in connection with a flock of these birds. There were seven or eight of them -which flew deUberately right on towards my fatlier and myself till they were within twentyfive yards of us, and then they doubled up into a confused clump, and I was already counting the slain when my gun missed fire. My father's did not, and gave us the opportunity of identifying the species. It breeds in Scotland and other countries far to the north. 231. BERNICLE GOOSE\\u2014 (^;wer leucopsis). Another winter visitor ; often appearing in great flocks, but always retiring to the north again to breed. It is supposed to frequent the shores of the White Sea especially for such purpose. 232. BRENT GOOSE\\u2014 (4;^.ye/- brcutu). Black Goose, Ware Goose. \\u2014 By far tlie most numerous of all the geese which visit oiir shores in winter, as it is also the least. I have seen it in inconceivable numbers on the Essex coast in hard winters, and the numbers reported to have been killed at one discharge of a heavy ]mnt-gun, seem simply incredible. In the very hard and loug-coutiuued winter of 1S37-3S, I saw the ice which, in broken fragments of four or five feet square by three or four inches thick, covered the whole estuary of the Blackwater at ToUesbury (a space ot very considerable width), black with them during highwater. The expression m.ade use of by one of the sea-faring men of the neighbourhood was, \\\"There are acres of 'em.\\\" StiU of all their vast numbers none remain to breed, and no great proportion of them are known to breed in Europe. 140 BRITISH BIRDS, TUEIR EGGS AND NESTS. 233.

Equally rare and more exceptional than the last : as the few that have occurred may have escaped from confinement. 235. SPUR-WINGED GOOSE\\u2014 (^\\u00ab5er Gambensis). Gambo Goose. \\u2014 An accidental visitor mdeed. 23G. CANADA GOOSE\\u2014 {Anser Ca)iadeiisis). Cravat Goose. \\u2014 Many of these remarkably fine birds are kept on ornamental waters in many different parts of the kingdom ; and these have been known sometimes (aided by a storm, perhaps. or some unusual occurrence) to make their escape. Many of the supposed wild birds shot, or otherwise taken, have been accounted for on the supposition that they are such escaped birds. However, it would seem most probable that considerable flights of really wild Cravat Geese do occasionally visit this country, and even that some pair or two of them may occasionally stay to breed. The eggs are six. to nine in number, of very large size and white. 237. llOOVEl\\\\\\u2014{C!/ffm(s feria). Wild Swan, Whistling Swan, Elk. \\u2014 Of sufficiently common occurrence on the British coasts, and particularly in hard winters. Few birds vary much more in size and weight than do these.

A bird of very rare occurrence in a wUd state, and deriving its Latin name from the circumstance that its plumage undergoes no change in colour at any period of its age. It is always wliite. The cygnets of the other swans are, on the contrary, grey or dusky-coloured for a lengthened period, and only become wliite on their reaching maturity. 241. RUDDY SHrELDRAKE\\u2014 (^fl^oraa rutila). A bird of exceedingly rare occurrence. 242. COMMON SHIELDRAKE\\u2014 (r\\u00ab^ora\\u00ab vulpamer). Burrow Duck, Skel Goose, Bar Goose. \\u2014 One of the very most beautiful of aU our wild fowl, or even of those which for their beauty are selected to be ornamental accessions to the waters of the park or pleasm-e-ground. Its plumage is so beautiful and clear and brilliant, and its attitude in repose so graceful, one camiot but admire it greatly. It breeds not uncommonly on many sandy parts of our coasts, occupying the deep rabbit-burrows, which are found in what are called the \\\" sand-hills,\\\" to place its nest in. Tiie nest is one reaUy, made of bents and dry stalks, and lined or cushioned with down liberally plucked from the builder's own breast. The number of eggs laid varies between eight or nine and twelve or fourteen. They are nearly or quite white, about 2f inches long by nearly 2 in breadth. I have known instances in which the eggs obtained from one of tlicir nests have been hatched under a common Hen. The young seemed to accustom themselves to their life of restraint tolerably 143 liUlTISII BllltS, rUEIR ECGS AND NESTS. well, out never showed any disposition to pair or breed. Fro. bably it might be because no suitable hole for a nest was withm their reach. The male of this species is known to assist the female in the labours and constraint of incubation. 243. SHOVELLER\\u2014 (^\\u00abas clypeatd). Elue-wiiiged Shoveller, Broad bill. \\u2014 The first ia the list of the true Ducks, and a very beautifully plumaged bird indeed. But gaily feathered as he is, and brilliant as is a part, at least, of the plumage of all the male Ducks during a certain portion of the year, yet it is remarkable that they all undergo a change in this respect about the breeding time, just the reverse of that which takes place in the males of so many other birds at the same season. They become more brilliant, or their colours deeper or richer then: \\u2014 the male ducks duskier, plainer coloui-ed, more like the female in her more unobtrusive hues. The Shoveller's biU is very remarkable, and, as I said of the Oyster-catcher's, a study for all who admu-e the works of God. It merits our notice for its adaptation to its purposes in a direction just opposite to that which characterizes the bill of the bird just named. Dilated at the sides so as almost to look awkward, it is furnished with a large series of very sensitive laminae or plates, such that the minute objects which form a considerable portion of the bird's food may be instantly detected by the sense of touch, and retamed. It used to breed very commonly in many parts of the kingdom, Norfolk and tlie Een districts for instance, as well as in. Homney Marsh and other places more in the south of the Island. At present it has become comparatively rare. The nest is made ol fine grass, and the eggs are eventually enveloped in down procured from the bird's o\\\\vn breast. The eggs may be from eight to twelve in number, white, tinged with a greenish-dun shade, and about 2 inches long by \\\\\\\\ broad. WILD r^LTK. 1*3 244. GADWALL\\u2014 (.//i\\u00ab5 sCreperu). Hodge, Grey Duck. \\u2014 A Duck which occurs L\\\\ no very great Ctimbers at any time ; mostly about the end of the -whiter, or in spring; and is not known to breed commonly in any part of ilorope. 2i5. PINTAIL BVGK\\u2014iAnas acuta) Cracker, \\\"Winter Duck. \\u2014 An early visitor to our sliores wliea winter has once urged the wild fowl hosts to leave their nortliern nesting-places. It is not, however, a numerous bird with us, but abounds in many of the northernmost countries of Europe. 246. BIMACULATED Ti\\\\]CYi\\u2014{AnasgIocitans). Hather a handsome bird in plumage and markings, but one of rare occurrence, and of which or its liabits very little is known. 247. WILD DUCK\\u2014 (^ms boschas). MaUard. \\u2014 By far the most common of all our wild fowl among the Ducks, but lessening, year by year, in the numbers which visit us. Within my own recollection many Decoys on the Essex coast were wrought constantly and successfully, which for many years now have been dismantled and unused. I well remember, when I was a lad of ten or twelve, being at a house in Tolleshunt D'Arcy, on the farm belonging to which was an active Decoy, and seeing the birds whicli had been taken in the course of one morning. Tlie numbers were so great tluit many of the undermost Ducks, where the great accumulation had taken place at the end of the \\\" pipe,\\\" bad died of pressure and suffocation, and some even were sensibly flattened by the superincumbent weight of their fellows. The multiplication of shooters on shore and afloat has sensibly tended to lessen the numbers of the Wild Duck ; while di-ainage on a large scale in many a district the country through, has materially lessened the number of their haunts. Still a very considerable number remain to breed, and 144 BlUTISU BIRDS, TllEIK EGGS AND NKSTB. a Wild Duck's nest in many parts of the kingdom is no raritj. The nest is made of grass, lined and interwoven -with down. It is customarily placed on dry ground on the margin of water, among reeds and bulrushes, or the like ; but may often be found at sorae distance from water, and in places so unlikely for the purpose as on tlie open moor, or in a tree top, or in tlie lofty deserted nest of a crow. The eggs are from nine to twelve in number, sometimes however exceeding the latter limit, of a ;\\u00bbreeuish-white colour, and about 2 j inches long by 1 1 broad. It is long before the young Wild Ducks fly well enough to leave their native reed beds, or similar shelter, and, in the state preceding that of actual power to fly away, they are called Flappers; and many a Flapper hunt have I taken part in in my youngei days. 248. GARGANEY\\u2014 (y/\\u00ab\\u00abi querquedidd). Summer Duck, Summer Teal, Pied Wiggon. \\u2014 This is a somewhat rare bird, and is seen sometimes in late autumn, but more usually in the spring. It has been known to breed in this country, though by no means commonly or frequently. It is said to make a nest among reeds of dry grass, rushes and down, and the number of eggs deposited to run from eight or nine tc twelve, or even more. They are of a disiiuct but pale bufT colour. If inch long by l^- broad. 249. TEAL \\u2014 {Anas crecca). A very pretty little Duck, and the least of all our wLite? visiters of that species. It is of common occurrence, but not met with in any great numbers. It breeds abundantly in Norway and Sweden, and especially in Lapland, whither the great oulk of our winter friends retire on the approach of the northern summer ; stiU, pairs often remain throughout the summer in various parts of oui- country to nest and rear their young. EIDER DUCK, 14? WTieu 1 was a boy 1 heard of nests, almost annually, on seme of the marshes 1 knew most familiarly. Tlie Teal builds a nest ot\\\" abundance of different vegetable substances, varying according to the locality and its productions, and luies it with down and feathers, the concealment afforded by the neiglibouring herb^e being carefully adopted. Eight to ten or twelve eggs are laid, of a buffy-white, If inch long by rather over 1^ broad. 250. WIGEON\\u2014 (^\\u00ab\\u00ab5 Penelope). Wliewer, V^Hum. \\u2014 Mr. Watertou has recorded an observation on the habits of this Duck, which is of great interest. Whereas, all the birds of the Duck-kind which we have hitherto named arp night-feeders, the Wigeon obtains its food by day, \\\" and that food is grass.\\\" The great body of our winter visitors of this species retire to the north to breed about the end of March, or April ; but a few have been ascertained to remain for that purpose in north Scotland. A nest, found on Loch Laighal in Sutherlandshire, was \\\" placed in the midst of a clump of grass, and was made of decayed rushes and reeds, with a lining of its own dowTi. The eggs were smaller than tliose of the Wild Duck, and of a rich cream-white colour.\\\" The number of eggs laid varies between five and eight or nine; the length, 2\\\\ inches by 1| in breadth. 251. AMERICAN TV^GEON\\u2014 (^\\u00aba5 Americana^ Of entirely rare and accidental occurrence. 252. EIDER ^^^^^\\u2014{Somatena mollissima), St. Cuthbert's Duck. \\u2014 We have now arrived at another section of the Duck family. Those hitherto named all frequent the fresh waters, and chiefly affect those that are of no great extent or depth. These, the first of which we have just named, frequent the sea or, in a few instances, the deepest parts of large freshwater lakes. The Eider Duck, well-known to most of us by t 146 BRITISH BIRDS, THEIR EGGS AND NESIS. name, to some of us by sight, breeds in some marshes on tb\\u00bb? Faroe islands, and in many of the islands on the coast of Scotland. The nests are principally composed, on a foundation of sea-weed cr grass, of the beautiful light elastic down, commonly known aa Eider-down ; and if the first is plundered, a second, and even \\u00bb third are formed ; but the down decreases in quality and quantity in each successive instance. The first accumulation is so large and springy as quite to conceal the eggs contained, which are usually five in number, and are of a light-green colour, about three inches long by two wide. The lining of one nest, admitting of easy compression by the hand, is described oy Mr. Hewitson as capable, when fully expanded, of filling a man's hat. 253. KING DJJCK\\u2014iSomaieria spectabilis). A much rarer bird than the last ; indeed occurring only very casually. It has been known to breed in one of the Orkney Islands, wliile Iceland, Nova Zcmbla, Spitzergen, and like localities, are the great breeding haunts of the species. The nests are made on the ground, and contain five eggs, very closely resembling the Eider-duck's, except in size. They are rather less. 254. STELLER'S WESTERN DUCK\\u2014 (Po.>5/eV/rt Stelleri). Exceedingly rare in Britain, and not much less so, it seems, in. Eui'ope generally. 255. \\\\T:LVET ^COTm.\\u2014{Oidemiafusca). Velvet Duck. \\u2014 A winter visitor, and rare on our south coasts. More common in the far north of Britain. 256. COMMON SCOTER.\\u2014 {Oidemia nigra). Scoter, Black Scoter, Black Duck, Black Diver. \\u2014 This duskycoloured Duck is seen in considerable numbers on various parts of our coasts in winter, and always swimming and diving in what may be called \\\" loose order,\\\" like the Coots rather than any TUFTED DUCK. 147 of the true Ducks. It does not, however, ever stay to breed with us, and can have no further notice nere. 257. SURF ^C01^K\\u2014{0idemia perspicillata). A bird of very rare, and, perhaps also it may be added, very local occurrence. 258. IIED-CRESTED WHISTLING Ji\\\\]CYi\\u2014{Fuligula rufina). Again another occasional vistor. 259. YOQjVLKSSi\\u2014iFuUgulafenna). Dunbird, lled-hcaded Wigeon, lied-headed Poker, Duncur. \\u2014 A whiter visitor, and in very considerable numbers in districts where the presence of inland waters to a s'xfBcient extent enables them to follow out then- natural habits. It is ahnost impossible, from their great quickness and skill in diving, to take them with tlie other \\\" Fowl \\\" in the Decoy, and they are therefore captured by a peculiar arrangement of nets affixed to poles so heavily weighted at one end as on being Liberated to elevate the net in such a way as to intercept the flight of the birds, as soon as they are fairly on wing. The Dimbu'd does not now breed in this country. 260. FERRUGINOUS DUCK\\u2014 (i^\\u00ab%\\u00ab/a nyroca). Somewhat resembling the Pochard in general hue, but smaller, and in respect of the numbers in which it has been met with in this country, comparatively a very rare visitor. 261. SCAUP DUCK\\u2014 (i^\\u00ab%/^/\\u00ab marila). Spoon-bill Duck. \\u2014 A winter visitor, and not an unusual one, although its numbers are never such as to commend it to notice in the same way as the Wild Duck, the Dunbird, the Wigeon, and some others. It breeds commonly in Iceland, but never in Britain. 262. TUFTED DUCK\\u2014 (i^\\u00ab%a& cristata). Another constant winter visitor, and as well or better known than the Scaup. Like the Scaup Duck it usually prefers oozy or muddy estuaries and their customary accompaniments. But L 2 148 BRITISH BIRDS, THJCIR EGGS AlUJJ StarB. have met willi it here in the narrow, rapid trout-stream which 1 uiis through this part of the country, and at a distance of not less than nine or ten miles from the sea. It breeds sparingly iu Holland and in more northerly countries. 2G3. LONG-TAILED T>VCY^\\u2014{Fulignla glasialii). Another bird wliicli, like the two last, is sufficiently wellknown witnout Demg exceedingly or indeed in the least degree numerous. It is in fact a rather rare and very beautiful Duck, and is remarkable for the great variations of plumage to which it 13 liable, according to differences of age, sex, and season. It breeds abundantly in Norway and Denmark, and much more so in puj-ely Arctic regions. 204. HAllLEQUIN DUCK\\u2014 (2^\\u00ab%a/\\u00ab histrionica). Another very beautiful bird, and most peculiarly marked. So much so as to remind its sponsors, as it appears, of the artistic effects produced by tlie customary pictorial adoriunent of our facetious friend Harlequin's face. A rarer bird, however, than even the Long-tailed Duck last named. 2C5. GOLDEN YXE\\u2014iFuligula clangula). Brown-headed Duck, Grey-lieaded Duck, Pied Wigeon, Goldeneyed Wigeon, Duck or Teal, Morillon, Rattlewings. \\u2014 As well known and as common as perhaps either the Scaup or the Tufted Duck, but known by different names according to the \\u2022tate of plumage depending on sex and age, females and young oirds being much more common than adult males. As not known to breed in England no notice of nest or eggs can be inserted here. In the Appendix, 'lowever, a very interesting notice of one of its habits connected with its breeding time will be inserted. 2GG. BUEEEL-HEADED DUCK\\u2014 (2^^%k/\\u00ab albeola). A visitor, but a very rare one, to our shores in winter. GOOSANDER. 149 207. SMEW\\u2014 (3/\\u00ab?;y/k\\u00ab albelliis). ^Hiite Nun, Red-headed Smew (for young), Smec, Lougn Diver, \\\"VVhite-lieaded Goosander. 'Uliite Merganser. \\u2014 This biru nelps us from tlie group of sea-loving Ducks jast noticed to that of the Mergansers, whose diving habits and powers may be interred from their names. Tiie Smew is perhaps quite the most common of tlie entire family; but they are very wary and difficult to api)roach. They are not known to breed m any part of the United Kingdom. 26S. HOODED :MERGx\\\\.NSER\\u2014 (^Ver^K* cvcuUatus). k. rare and accidental visitor to this country, and indeed to the European continent. 169. RED-BREASTED MERGANSER\\u2014 (.l/er^K* serrator. Red-breasted Goosander. \\u2014 This handsome bird is an undoubted denizen of our country during the breeding season, but in nr> great numbers in any year or district. It breeds in Ireland, on islands in several of the Loughs ; also in the Hebrides and otjier Scottish islands. The nest is made of long grass or moss, small roots, di-y water-herbage, mixed and lined with the bird's own down, doubtless added to as incubation proceeds. It is often placed at the foot of a tree, if there be one on the islet selected. The eggs are six to nine in number, of a pale buff or fawncolour. They are 2| inches long by If broad. 270. GOOSANDER.\\u2014 (J/er^\\u00ab5 merganser). Dun Diver, Sparling Fowl, Jacksaw, Saw-biU. \\u2014 A few of these birds also remain to breed in Britain, though by far the most retire to the north of Europe for that purpose. Its nests are common in both the Orkney Islands and the Hebrides. They are large, made of dry grass and roots, and lined with the down of ^le female, and placed amid bushes or stones, or in some cavity afforded by an old tree. The eggs rarely exceed six or seven, 150 BKITISII BIKDS, THEIR EGGS AND NESTS. not varying much in shade from those last descnbed, and are 2| inches in length, by nearly ] | in breadth. II.\\u2014 COLTMBIDtE. 271. GREAT CRESTED GR'EBK\\u2014{Podiceps crisiains}. Cargoose, Loon, Greater Loon, Tippet Grebe. \\u2014 We have come now to the Divers properly so called, and the family of Grebes to be noticed first are to be looked upon as principally out not exclusively, frequenting the fresh water. The bii-d now under notice remains almost all the year on the large sheets of water which it inhabits in Wales, Shropshire, Norfolk, and Lincolnshire. Like the rest of the Grebes, it is little able to walk and not much disposed to fly, but possessing marvellous capacity and power of diving. Its nest is made of a large heap of half rotten waterweeds, but little raised above the surface of the water, and always soaked with wet. On this likely-seeming place for duly addling every egg deposited, three, four or five eggs are laid, which are almost white when newly di'opped, but soon become so stained from constant contact with wet and decaying vegetable substances as to be any colour rather than white. They are about 2i inches long, by 1^ broad. The eggs, in the absence of the parent bu'd, are usually found covered with portions of some water vegetable ; and the owner, on being disturbed on her nest, always dives away from it. The first lessons of the young Loon in diving are taken beneath the literal \\\" shelter of their mother's wing.\\\" 272. RED-CRESTED GR'EBR\\u2014iPodiceps rubnccUis), Not so common as the Grebe last named, and more frequently met with on salt water, though not usually far from some estuary or inland arm of the sea. It is cot known to iiave bred in thia country. LlTlLli GREBE. ]51 273. SCLAVONIAN GR'EB'E\\u2014iPodicejJs cornutm). Dusky Grebe, Horned Grebe. \\u2014 Rather a rare bird in tlie summer, and not common at any period of tiie year; nor has it ever been known to breed with us. 274. EARED GREBE\\u2014 (Po(//c^s awnto). The rarest of all the Grebes. It occurs however from time to time, and I knew of one instance in Esses some thirty years ago in which one of these birds was taken from a \\\"Water-Rat's hole into which it had been seen to creep for shelter. 275. LITTLE GREBE\\u2014 (Por//c^^5 minor). Dabchick or Dobchick, Didapper, Small Ducker, Blackchiu Grebe. \\u2014 A very common and very interesting little bird, and yet, in spite of its frequency and familiarity, blessed with a couple of scientific names, originating (as in the case of the Dunlin), in differences of plumage, depending on age or season. It is difficiJt to say where it is 7wt to be met with in spring, provided only there be what the Americans call a sufficient \\\" waterprivilege,\\\" neither too shallow nor too rapid, for its requirements. As expert a diver as any of those hitherto named, it seldom resorts to the use of its wings, except just at the time when bu'ds' lovemakuig goes on. Then the male (at least) may be seen working his short wings most vigorously and rapidly, uttering his rattling cry as he circles over and about the Mere on which he has \\\" squatted \\\" for the season. The nest is a lieap of water weeds only just flush with the surface, and always steeping wet. The eggs are four, five or six in number, perfectly white when laid, but soon ceasing to be clean-looking, for they grow more dingy day by day, until on some waters they become completely mudcoloured, on others, assume a hue which I can compare to nothing but old blood stains on some du-ty surface. I am quite convinced that in some cases at least this discolouration is intentional on the 152 BRlTlSn BIRDS, THEIR EGGS AND KEtTS. part of the parent bird, though in others it may be simpl^f due tc the action of the juices of fresh or decaying vegetable substances I never yet, though I have seen some dozens of nests, found the eggs left uncovered by the owner, save only in one instance, in which only one egg had been laid. The weeds used as a covering were, moreover, in the majority of instances, fresh, and evidently procured by the Dabchick in virtue of her skill in diving. The young birds swim and dive almost immediately they are hatched, and are very persevering little skulkers if disturbed on their breeding waters. 276. GREAT NORTHERN BlVI.n\\u2014iColt/mdus fflacialis). Greatest Speckled Diver, Great Doucker,Immer,Immer Diver. \\u2014 This magnificent bird \\u2014 I shot one, in full plumage, several years since, which weighed nearly thirteen pounds \\u2014 is usually found at some distance from the coast, except during that part of the year which is devoted to the work of propagation. There seems good reason to think some of them may breed in some of the most northerly British Islands, but no authentic history of its ever naving been known to do so, is, I believe, extant. 277. BLACK-TIIROATED DIVLR\\u2014 (Co/ymi\\u00abs ardicus). Lumme, Norlliern Doucker, Speckled Loon. \\u2014 The rarest of the three Divers known in our seas. It is, however, described as breeding in several ol the lakes of Sutherlandshire. It makes no nest, but lays its two eggs on the bare ground, at no great distance from the water-edgo. These aie in some instances of a light shade of chocolate-brown, others having more of an olive-brown tinge about them, and sparingly spotted with black. 278. RED-THROATED J)lTE.R\\u2014{Coli/mbus sepleniriomli.\\\"). Rain Goose, Cobble, Sprat-borer, Spratoon, Speckled Divct COMMON GUILLEMOT. 153 \\u2014 The commonest and the smallest of the Divers, and vailing greatly in their plumage, according to age and season. It breeds on the Scottish mainland, m Shetland, in the Hebrides, and until lately in the Orkneys. The eggs are said to be always deposited very near the water's edge. They are two in number, of a greenisli brown colour, spotted with very dark brown, but, as Mr. Yarrell states, when the egg has been long sat upon the brown groundcolour is apt to assume a chestnut, or dark reddish-brown tint. III.\\u2014 ALCAD^. 279. COMMON GUILLEMOT\\u2014 (f/'nr/ Iroile). Foolish Guillemot, \\\"VVillock, Tinkershere, Tarrock, Scout, Sea- Hen, Murre, Lavy. \\u2014 The first on the list of our Ptockbirds, as they are often called. It is remarkable in several particulars connected with its breeding peculiarities. It makes no nest and lays but one egg, but that an egg of huge dimensions as contrasted with the size of the bird itself; besides which, it is almost impossible out of a collection of many scores to pick out half a dozen that are precisely alike, either in ground-colour or general markings. The eggs are laid on the ledges of rocky precipices overhanging the sea, on various parts of the British coasts. 1 have frequently seen the \\\"VVDlocks under the impulse of a sudden alarm \\u2014 for instance, the firing of a gun in the close vicinity of their egg-bestrown ledges \\u2014 fly off in very large numbers and with every symptom of precipitation. But no egg is ever dislodged ; a cii'cumstance which some Have sought to account for on the supposition that they must be cemented to the rockj The explanation really is, it would seem, that the shape of the eggs is such that, instead of rolling off in any direction, as a :.all would do on being sufficiently moved, they simply turn round ana vour.i witliin the length of their own axis. It would serve 154 BKlTlin BIRDS, TUEIR EGGS AXD NESTS. but little purpose to attempt a description of the Guillemot's figg. They are of all shades, from nearly or quite white to a dark green, some profusely spotted and blotched and streaked with, dark colours, others very slightly so or scarcely at all. Unfortunately the egg is so large that but two illustrations can be given in the limited space available to us. \\u2014 Fiff. 1, 2, j}late X. 280. BRUNNICH'S GUILLEMOT\\u2014 (Z7n\\u00ab Brunnichii). Thick-billed Guillemot. \\u2014 Easily distinguished by an experienced eye from the last, but a bird of which, perhaps, it can scarcely be said that it has been actually ascertained to breed any where within the limits of the British Isles. The eggs are described as varying from those of the Common Guillemot in their greater roundness ; they are less long in proportion to their thickness than the others, but seem to run through the sanitj endless variations of ground-colour. 281. RINGED GUILLEMOT\\u2014 (^/-/^ lacrpnans). Bridled Guillemot. \\u2014 There has been some doubt whether this bird is to be considered a distinct species, or merely a variety of the Common Guillemot. It is now, however, generally admitted as a good species. It occurs in company with the other Guillemot on various parts of our coasts, and in Wales is said to be equally numerous with it. The eggs are distinguishable from those of the other two species already named, but still exhibiting precisely similar characteristics. 282. BLACK GUILLEMOT\\u2014 (6Vi\\u00ab^;y//e). Tyste, Seraber, Greenland Dove, Sea Turtle. \\u2014 Sensibly less in size than the Common Guillemot, and not found commonly on our more southerly coasts. Shetland, the Orkneys and Western Isles are all frequented by thcin, and their quick and lively motions are pleasant enough to witness. These birdv lay two eggs each instead of one, in holes or crevices of pre\\u00ab PUFHN. 135 cipitous rocks, and at some distance from the aperture ; sometimes, where no such nest-sites are available, on the bare ground, under or between fragments of rock or large stones. They are most commonly white more or less tinged with blue, specklea, spotted and blotched or marbled with chestnut brown, very dark brown and a kind of neutral tint. \\u2014 Fig. 3, plate X. 283. LITTLE A.\\\\]K\\u2014(Merffidus melanoleucos). I have rarely seen any bird, much more a very small bird like this, whose whole air and deportment conveyed to me more completely the idea of entire independence. Only under the pressure of severe storms or long continued hard weather do they leave the deep sea in order to seek the comparative shelter of some land-sheltered bay or reach. It breeds on the Faroe Isles and in Iceland, but not in Britain. 284. '2'[]Y'Sl'^\\u2014{Fra(ercula arctica). Sea Parrot, Coulterneb, Tammy Norie. \\u2014 This is, one may safely say, the quaintest-looking of all the host of our Enghsh birds. The young Owl is grotesque enough, but more by reason of its deliberate, solemn-seeming and yet laughable movements; but the P uffin , with its upright attitude and liuge ribbed and painted beak \\u2014 reminding one somewhat strongly of the highly-coloured pasteboard noses of preposterous shape and dimensions wliich decorate the windows of the toy-shop \\u2014 strikes us as more laughably singular yet. They breed abundantly about many of our rocky coasts m all parts of the kingdom, depositing their one egg \\u2014 a large one, again, in proportion to the size of the bird \\u2014 sometimes in crannies or rifts in the surface of the cliff, often very far back ; at other times in rabbit-buiTows where such excavations ore to be met with sufficiently near the coast and otherwise suitable to the wants of the bird. It does not foUow that because the Puffin occupies tlie hole, that the rabbit had forsaken it or 156 BRITISH BIRDS, THEIR EGGS AND NESTS. even given it up \\\" for a consideration.\\\" On tlie contrary tlie Puffin is quite ready and equally able to seize on and continue to occupy the desired home by force of arms. In other cases they dig their own holes, and often excavate them to the depth of two or three feet. The eggs are nearly white before they become soiled \\u2014 that is spotted and marbled with a tinge of ash colour. 2S5. llAZOR-BILL~(Alca torda). llazor-bill Auk, Black-billed Auk, Murre, Marrot. \\u2014 It may almost be said that wherever the Guillemot is met with the Razor-bill is sure not to be far distant. They have their habits their food, their haunts, even to a great degree their general appearance, in conunon. There is, however, a great difference both in the shape and size and also in the colouring of the single egg laid by the Hazor-blll, from that of the Willock. It is less in proportion, less elongated, wants the infinite diversity of colouring which characterises the cg^ of the latter, the ground-colour being always whitish or white tinged with some light buffy shade, and the spots and blotches, which are siifficiently abundant, are some of a reddish or chestnut brown, others of a very deep rich brown. \\u2014 Fig. 4, flute X. 2S0. GREAT AUK\\u2014 (^/crt impemis). Gair-Fowl. \\u2014 Not merely an exceedingly rare British bird, but It is to be feared, extinct as a British species. Where it is yet ia existence it is said scarcely ever to leave the water, and it lays its one large egg almost close to high-water mark. These eggt are white in ground, or sometimes soiled or slightly yellowish wliite, blotched and streaked, most at the larger end, with black. They somewhat resemble the Guillemot's (^g in shape, but are rather less elongated. The value of these eggs is aimost suAG, L57 fabulous, sixty guineas* bavinej been given for a couple of them. I have to thank Mr. Chanipley, C.E., of Scarborough, for most kindly sending me an engraving of a Great Auk's egg in his possession, as well as for offering me access to his admirable coilection of eggs, numbering upwards of SOOO specimens.

Crested Cormorant, Corvorant, Great Black Cormorant, Cole Goose, Skart. \\u2014 \\\"V^Hierever there are any traces of a rocky coast about our island, there the Cormorant is pretty sure to be found, so that he may very well be described as a common bird. Where the rocky coast is not only extensive, but not liable to much disturbance from human intrusion, these birds abound, and may be seen in numbers and observed to anyone's heart's content- They build their nests, which arc of ample size, with sticks, seaweed and coarse herbage of any obtainable sort, on ledges of the precipices ; and many nests are usually formed in the near neighbourhood of each other. They are much disposed also to select as the situation for their nests a rocky islet with cliffy sides, and woe to the nose of anyone who approaches such an island-rock from the leeward side. What from the nature of their food and the abundance of their excrement, an intolerably fetid odour always prevails about their breeding-place. The eggs vary in number from four to six, and are almost entirely covered over with a white chalky incrustation, which, however, admits of easy removal by a knife or similar means, leaving a shell of a bluishgreen colour apparent. 2S8.

As to habits and haunts the differences are not great. The Shags are said to breed lower down on the rocks than the Cormorant, and the nests are principally composed of sea weed and grasses. The eggs are three to five in number, and covered with the same incrustation as those of the Cormorant, and equally removable. White at first, they soon become as soiled and stained as tliose of the Grebes. 2S9. GANNET.\\u2014 (/S^fe Bassana).

When the breeding time comes round, they congregate in hosts of many thousands at some half-dozen different stations, particularly affected by them on different parts of our coasts. During the breeding season they become exceedingly tame, and wiU even suffer themselves to be touched. Tliey make their nests of a large mass of sea weed and dry grass, on rather than in which they lay each one single tg^, of no very considerable size. This, when first laid, is white or bluish-white, (the colour being dae to an incrustation similar to that of the Cormorant's egg), but soon becomes soiled and stained. v.\\u2014 LAEID^. 290. CASPIAN TEllN\\u2014 (67fra\\u00ab Caspta). The first member of the last Family of British birds, comprising many birds of habits and peculiarities as widely distinct, when it is remembered they are all water-birds, from those of the two Families last nader notice, as is readily conceivable. The Grebes, Divers, Cormorants, all gifted with wonderful powers of diving; the Gulls and Terns incapable of diving an inch; the latter, buoyant and bitting as lightly on the water as a cork ; the former deep-sunken ROSEATE TERN. 15^ in the water, and seeming to require almost an effort to support themselves on the surface at all. The contrast is certainly sufficiently striking, \\u2022vrlthout taking into account that the one group has immense power of flight, and exercises it ; and the others seem to have little inclination to use their wings at all, more than is absolutely necessary. The handsome and large Tern, specially under notice, does not breed in this country, but is known to inhabit the coast of some parts of the European continent, at no great distance from our own shores. 291.--SAND-WICII TI^'R'N\\u2014iS/erna Cantiaca). This bird has been noticed as breeding in several different localities on our southern coasts, and it is known to frequent both Coquet Island and one or more of the Fame Islands for the same purpose. It lays three or four eggs in a hole, or rather cavity, either scratched or found ready-made in the neighbourhood of plants or herbage sufScient to afford some covert. The colour of the eggs varies from yellowish white to a buffy stonecolour, and they are thickly spotted with neutral tint, chestnut and deep rich brown. There is, indeed, considerable variat ion m the colouring of the eggs, but all are very beautiful. \\u2014 Fig. ], 2, vlate XI. 292. ROSEATE TEK^\\u2014 {Sterna Doyffallii). This bird is now known to be a regular but not abundant summer visitor. Unlike many of our recognised British Birds, this Tern seems rather to increase in numbers than to diminish. They associate with other and infinitely more common species, and closer observation only lias distinguished between them and their eggs and those of their more numerous associates. The eggs of the Roseate Tern are two or three in number, and vary among themselves to some small extent. They are usually of a 160 BRITISH BIRDS, THEIR EGGS AND NESTS. liglit yellowish stone-colour, spotted and speckled with dark-p;re? and dark-brown. 293. COMMON TERN\\u2014 (<S/\\u00ab-\\u00ab\\u00ab hirundo). Sea Swallow, Tarney or Pictamey, Tarrock, Pirr, Gull-teazer, &c. \\u2014 ^Although distinguished by the epithet of Common, this Tern is really not much more numerous, and in that sense common, than one or two other species with which it customarily consorts. It is very generally diffused however, and in that sense w common. It usually biulds on the ground in marshy localities near large sheets of water, or on islands low and flat not far from the sea. Sometimes, though more rarely, it builds upon low rocks or slightly elevated sand-banks. They lay two or three eggs, and are exceedingly and noisily restless and uneasy when they, or especially their yoiuig, are too nearly approached. Their eggs vary a good deal, but most of them are of a medium stone-colour, blotched and spotted with ash-grey and dark red-brown. The buoyancy and power of flight exhibited by these birds is very observable. \\u2014 Fij. 3, 'plate XT. ARCTIC TERN\\u2014 (iS^eraa ardica). This Tern, until a comparatively recent period, was confounded with the Common Tern, but a clear specilic difference was pointed out by M. Temmiuck, and it is now acknowledged that, in maiiy of the more nortlierly localities especially, it is a much more numerous species than the Common Tern. It breeds plentifully m Shetland, Orkney and some parts of the Hebrides, and in great numbers on Coquet Island and one or more of the Fames. It lays two or three eggs, which are exceedingly like those of tiie Common Tern, and vary in the same proportion. Some have 3 ijreenish shade, and others rather a pronounced buff, spotted and BUCK TERN. 161 blotched as ;n the case of those of the last-named specica. \\u2014 Fig. 4, plate XI. 295.

It seems to prefer sand or shinglebanks or surfaces, and lays its two or three eggs in any small cavity which it may be lucky enough to find in the selected place. It is perfectly surprising in many cases how closely the eggs laid resemble the stones and gravel among which they are laid. They are palish stone-colour, speckled and spotted with ash-grey and dark brown. \\u2014 Fig. 5, plate XI. 298. BLACK TEK^\\u2014iSierna nigra). Blue Darr. \\u2014 These birds show considerable varieties in plumage, according to sex and age. They used to be very much more numerous than they now are, many of their favourite haunts having been drained or otherwise broken up. Still it is not uncommon, even yet, in some parts of the fenny districts \\u2014 g'.though other Terns build in the close vicinity of the sea, atid in dry sites. The Black Tern, however, selects marshy places and often builds in very wet spots, making a nest of flags and grass. The eggs are sometimes four in number, this being the only Tern which lays more than three. They vary much in colour and markings, some being of a palish green, others of a brownish yellow, or dull buff, but all spotted and blotched with deep brown.

Brown-headed Gull, Red-legged Gull, Laughing Gull, Pewit Gull, Black-cap, Sea Crow, Hooded Mew. \\u2014 This is a very numerous, and at least, at some periods of the year, a very generally diffused species. At the breeding time, although a few pairs may be met with in an infinite number of localities, the great bulk of the species seems to collect at a few chosen places. One such place, in wliich they breed in thousands, is on Scoulton Mere, in Norfolk ; another at PaUinsburn, in Northumberland ; and a tliird, in Lincolnsliire, not fur from Brigg. The nests are made of sedges, grass and the flowering part of the reed, and are not very deeply cup-sliaped. The bird lays three eggs, and there is a very great degree of variation between them in respect of colour and markings ; the ground-colour being sometimes of a light blue or yellow, and sometimes green, or red, or brown. Some, too, are thickly covered with spots, and others scarcely marked with a single speckle or spot. In more than one of their great COMMON GULL. 103 breeding-places the right or gathering the eggs is rented, and sonaetimes upwards of a thousand eggs are collected in a single day. When the first laying of eggs is taken, a second batch, and even a third is produced ; but in each successive instance, the eggs become less. They are used as the Pewit's eggs are, and also for culinary purposes, being sold for about fivepence a score. \\u2014 Fig. 7, plate XI. 304. LAUGHING-GULL\\u2014 (Z\\u00abrK5 atricilla).

It places its nest of sea-weed high up on the face of some rocky steep on a narrow ledge, and deposits therein, for the most part, three eggs. These differ much in colour and in the amount and position of the spots ; some are stone-coloured, some tinged with an olive shade, and some with a bluish cast.

Its nest may sometimes be found on marshes M 2 164 BlUTISII BIRDS, TIIEIK EGGS AND NESTS. or low. flat islands, such as are not rare in some of our southern estuaries, while in other districts it breeds ou high rocks. In either case, tlie nest is a structure of considerable size, formed o( sea-weed and grass, and the female deposits two or three eggs in it, which are a good deal varied in appearance : \\\" Some,\\\" says JNlr. Hewitson, \\\" with a ground-colour of light blue, or strawcolour, others green or brown ; some a good deal like eggs of the Ojster-catcher, others covered all over with minute spots.\\\" Some, moreover, are sufficiently well blotched and spotted with ashcolour and dark-brown; others well streaked with the brown. but with only a few spots of the grey colour. \\u2014 Fig. 2, plale XII. 308.

Ycllow-leggcd Gull.\\u2014 This Gull is seen in sufficient numbers, and all the year round, on many parts of the British coasts, and in the south as well as the north. It almost exclusively prefers localities to breed in which are characterised by the presence of rocky cliffs, but yet makes a nest of some considerable thickness \\u2014 even when placed ou the grassy summit of some rocky island \\u2014 \\\" of grass loosely bundled together in large pieces, and placed in some slight depression or hollow of the rock.\\\" Its nests are intermingled, in several places, with those of the Herring Gull ; in many places greatly exceeding those of the latter, in others as greatly inferior, in number. The eggs (two or three in number) vary greatly in colouring, \\u2014 from a warm stone-colour, through shades of brown, to pale green or light oUve-green.

I have seen it abundantly at Flamborough Head and St. Abb's Head, and in smaller numbers on many parts of the Yorkshire coast north of Flamborough, as well as in. others not distant from St. Abb's. It usually selects for the site of its nest a flat ledge or other rock-surface towards the upper part of the cliff ' but win sometimes build on a low rock or grassy island. Tht. nest is like that of the last species, but even larger, and usually contains three eggs. These so strongly resemble those of the Lesser Black-back as to make it very difficult to distingush between the one and the otlier. Mr. Hewitson says the only means of distinction available even to an experienced eye seem to depend on the somewhat greater size of the Herring Gull's egg, and the larger and more confluent character of the blotches of surface colour. \\u2014 Fig. 4, plate XII. 311. GREAT BLACK-BACKED Gl]l.L\\u2014(Larusmarinus). Black-back, Cob, Great Black-and-white GuU. \\u2014 By no means a numerous species, and not affecting society as so many of the other Gulls do. It breeds, in some cases, on the Marsh or Saltingspaces met with so abundantly on some, of the southern and eastern shores ; but more commonly on rocky parts of the coast. Thus, it breeds very abimdautly on the Orkney and Shetland Islands. Tlic nest is made of a large quantity cf dry grass simply thrown together. The eggs are three in number, often bearing a great resemblance to those of tlie two species last 166 BlUTISU BIRDS, TUEIU EGGS AND KES18. named, but usually distinguishable by the larger masses of surface colouring, and by some superiority in size. The Black back's eggs are much esteemed as articles of food, or for cooking purposes generally. The yolk is very deep and rich-coloured, and the white colourless or transparent. Each female wUl lay tliree sets of eggs ; the first two sets being, in some cases, customarily taken, and the last left for her to hatcn. 312. GLAUCOUS GJJLlj\\u2014iLarusfflaucus). Large White-winged GuU, Burgomaster. \\u2014 A GuU equally large with the last, one of which, shot by myself, exceeded six feet from the tip of one wing to that of the other ; but one of merely casual occurrence as a British bird. 313. COMMON SKUK\\u2014iLesMs catarrades). Skua GuU, Brown GuU, Bonxie. \\u2014 We pass here into a somewhat different class of birds. The Skua is as bold and insolent as most of the GuUs are timid and retiring. In many instances these birds do not take the trouble to fish for themselves, but, watching the fishing operations of the Gull, seize their opportunity of assailing a successful fisher, and compel him to disgorge his prey. The Common Skua has only a very limited breedmgrange in Britain, not beiag known to nest out of Shetland, and to have but three places for nidification there. So resolute and daring are they when they have young to defend, they do not scruple to attack the eagle, and a pair have been known to beat the strong, proud marauder effectually off. The Skua makes a large nest of moor-growing moss, and takes some pains in its construction. It is placed among the heath and moss of a hiUy island. The eggs are two in number, and vary much in coloui- ; according to locality it would almost seem. Some are dusky FULMAR PETREL. 167 olive brown, others with a much greener hue, and they are blotched with darker brown, and a few spots of rust colour. 314. POMARINE SKV A.\\u2014{Lestris Pomarinus). Merely a casual visitor, although more frequently noticed of late years than before ornithology became so favourite a study. 315. RICHARDSON'S SKUA\\u2014 (Zes^m Richardsonii). Arctic Gull, Black-toed Gull, Arctic Skua. \\u2014 This species is the most numerous of all those which visit this country. It breeds in the Hebrides, in the Orkneys and in Shetland, and numerously enough in the two localities last named. The female has been observed to make use of the same artifices as the Partridge and the Grouse to decoy an intrusive dog or man away from its nest or young. The nest is built of moss or ling, on some elevated knoll amid marshy ground, or on the moor, and coutaius two eggs. These are of a greenish olive-brown colour, spotted with dark browni. This Skua not only restlessly and pitilessly persecutes the Kittiwake and other Gulls in order to obtain its own food from them at second-hand, but also makes free with their eggs for the same purpose in a very marauder-like fashion. \\u2014 Fir/. 5, plate Xlf. 316. BUEEON'S SKUA\\u2014 (Ze^^m Buffonii). Mr. Yarrell distiaguishes between this bird and the true L. Parasiticus, and consequently adopts the scientific name I have now given. This Skua can only be considered a rare and accidental visitor. 317. FULMAR PETREL\\u2014 (P;-oceJ&r?\\u00ab glacialis). Fulmar, Northern Fulmar. \\u2014 The Fulmar breeds in incredible numbers at St. KUda, but is rarely met with, even in winter, about the southern coasts of England. Both old birds and their young on being touched eject a considerable quantity of 168 BRITISH BIRDS, THEIR EGGS AND XESTS. clear oil, v/hicli, however, is by no means of an agreeable odour ; and probably from this cause the nest, young birds, and even the rock on which they are placed, stink almost intolerably. The nest is very slight, if any, and the bird lays her single white egg in little excavations, and lightly lined, on such shelves on the face of high precipitous rocks as are surfaced with a little grass or sward. The egg varies in length from a Httle over 2i inches to 3 inches. 318. GREATER SHEARWATER\\u2014 (P#\\u00ab2\\u00ab major). Cinerous Shearwater, Dusky Shearwater. \\u2014 A bird which has not been very frequently recorded as met with on the British seas, but still one of occasional occiirrence. 319. :MANX SHEARWATER\\u2014 (P\\u00ab#\\u00abm5 Angiorum). Shearwater Petrel, Manx Puffin. \\u2014 This is a regular sea-taring little bird, and perhaps would hardly ever care to come to land if it weie not for the need of something solid for its eggs to repose upon. It usually frequents islands well-washed by the sea and not much frequented by men. It used to be very abundant on the Calf of Man, but is never seen there now. In one of the Scilly Islands it breeds in some numbers still, and on St. KUda, the Western Isles, Orkney and Shetland. The nest is made deep down in a hole in some wild and half inaccessible part of the islands frequented, and in it one egg ot exceeding whiteness is laid, and remarkable for the fine texture ot the shell amd the musky scent of the entire egg. It is about 2\\\\ inches long by 1| broad. 320. BULWER'S '\\u00a3'^TKEL\\u2014{Thalassidroma Bulwerii). A Petrel of sufficiently rare occurrence. 321.

Subject to tlie same remark as the two last. 323. STORM \\\"BETMli\\u2014^Thalassidroma procellaria). Mother Carey's Chicken. \\u2014 This is said to be the smallest webfooted bird known, and it is the last as well as the least. It nevei comes to the shore except at the breeding-season, and only seeks comparative shelter under the pressure of very heavy weather. It breeds in the SciUy Islands, some of the islands on the Irish coast, and abundantly on St. Kilda, the Orkneys and Shetland. They breed in holes in a cliff, or under large-sized stones, which, from their great size and the accumulation of boulders and large shingle about them, afford many deep recesses well suited to the wants of the nesting Petrel. Like the Manx Shearwater, they are by no means silent m. their nest-holes, but make themselves distinctly audible to the passenger above. They lay one white esrg, a little exceediag 1 inch long, by J nroad. * TJie simpUst and best way ofblovying eggs is to drill a hole in one side [not at the ends), then taking the egg, hole downwards, between the finger and thumb of the left hand, place the blowpipe pioint jicst outside the hole, and blow into the egg ; this will force out the contents. When this is done, blow a little clean water into the egg, and shake it well; then remove the \\\\oater in the same way as a.bove, and allow the egg to dry, hole downwards, on blotting paper ; it will then be quite clean. APPENDIX. Our object in adding this Appendix is simply a wish to make the book more complete by adding notices, more or less detailed, of the nests and eggs and any interesting breeding-season peculiarities of birds recognized as really well entitled to the name of British Birds, but not happening to remain within the limits of Britain to breed. The first bird of the kind i\\\" that which, in our complete list, is numbered 7. GREENLAND FAl.GON. The equivalent to Mr. Yarrell's Gyr Falcon. 8. ICELAND FALCON. These two species are now, I believe, looked upon as established, but the differences between them are not excessively striking, except it be to a scientific naturalist. Mr. Hewitson has figured an egg of tlie Iceland Falcon which he believes may have lost some of its colour. It was taken from a neat made with sticks and roots, lined with wool, which once perhaps was the nest of a Raven. The nest in question was in a cliff, and had the remains of manysortsof birds\\u2014 Whimbrels, Golden Plovers, GuUlemots, Ducks\\u2014 strewed round it. The egg is of a bufFy red colour, mottled and speckled\\u2014 very thickly in places\\u2014 with deeper red. 30. SNOWY OWL. SuflSciently often met withinNorth Britain (and even occurring sometimee in England) to merit a short notice here. It inhabits Sweden, Norway, Lapland and the greater part of Northern Europe. These birds are accustomed to take their prey by daylight, and seem, from the accounts received, to be 172 In the habit of\\\" bolting \\\" their food, when not vei-y largo, whole. It makes its nest on the ground, and lays in it three or four white eggs. 54. GREAT GEEY SHRIKE. This bird is met with in Denmark and other northern countries of Western Europe, and also in Russia, Germany and France, It is said to frequent wocds and forests, and to build upon trees at some distance from the ground, as well as in thick bushes and hedges. The nest is made of roots, moss, wool and dry stalks, lined with dry grass and root-fibres. The eggs are four to seven in number, and though they vary a good deal in colour, they always illustrate the peculiar tendency of the eggs of the Shrikes to show a sort of zone or girdle, due to the agglomeration of the spots about some part of the circumference. They are yellowish or greyish white, and the spots of grey and light brown. 42. FIELDFARE. I have sometimes seen this favourite game-bird of the sohool-boy here as early as the latter part of September, and I have frequently noticed them foeding in hundreds on the holly berries which abound in more than one part of this district. They must breed very late in the year from the late period of their departure hence, and the distance of the countries to which many of them resort for that purpose. It breeds very abundantly in Norway, and also in Sweden, Russia and Siberia, not to mention other and more southerly countries in Europe. Their nests, in Norway, are usually bailt ^gainst the trunk of the spruce-fir, and at very variable heights from the ground. They are said to be very like those of the Ring Ouzel, except that small twigs are added to th^i outside structure. The eggs are from three to five, and are very like those of the Ring Ouzel, but with somewhat more red about them. The Fieldfare seems to prefer breeding in numerous groups or colonies, two or three hundi ed nests oeuig frequently seen within a i'ather limited space. 43.' REDWING. This winter visitor is known to breed occasionally, but yet only very excopt'onally, in this country. A nest was brought to me two summers since, whicli, from its construction, the size and cokuring of the eggs, and espotially from the description of the bird which my informal. t saw leaving th\\u00ab APPENDIX. 173 D\\u00ab8t, I have little doubt was a Redwing. It breeds abundantly in Sweden and in lesser niimbexs in Norwaj , and is described as being a very sweet su;ger, as heard among the forest solitudes of the latter country. Its nest is very similar to those of the Blackbird, Ring Ouzel and Fieldfare, in materials and structure. The eggs are four to six in number, and very similar, allowing for a little inferiority in size, to those of the Fieldfare, and to very red specimens of the Uing Ouzel's. 91. SNOW BUNTING This bird resorts in the breeding-season to the \\\" Arctic Regions and tlie Islands of the Polar Sea.\\\" Mr. Yarrell says, \\\" the nest is composed of dry grass, neatly lined with deers' hair and a few feathers, and is generally fixed in a crevice of a rock, or in a loose pile of timber or stones. The eggs are a greenish white, with a circle of irregular umber-brown spots round the thick end, and numerous blotches of subdued lavender purple.\\\" 98. MOUNTAIN FINCH. This Finch is occasionally met with in sufficient numbers to be deserving of a short notice here. It seems to breed in Denmark, Norway, and Lapland, and it is at least possible that a few pairs may, from time to time, stay to nest with us. It is said to build in fir-trees, though from Mr. Hewitsou's account, the nests are by no means easy to find. The following is an account of a nest made by a pair in an aviary at Becclcs in Suffolk : \\u2014 \\\" Tlie nest was deep, the walls thick, a large quantity of materials employed for the foundation which was worked among the stalks of the ivy-leaves. It was composed of moss, wool, and dry grass ; and lined with hair.\\\" The general appearance of the eggs is one of resemblance to those of the Chaffinch ; the spots however, seeming to be fewer, smaller and less decided. 104,. SISKI.X. This little bird lias been known in several instances to breed with us in its natural wild condition, but its nesting-home is in Russia, Germany and north-western Europe. It has been ascertained to build in furze bushes, and also close to the trunk of a fir-tree, where a projecting bough afforded support for the structure. The nest is composed of similar materials to the Chaffinchs', and the eggs present a good deal of resemblance to those of the Goldfinch, with a little inferiority in size. l74 170. TURNSTONE. This very handsomely pIumap;od. bird inhabits the countries bordering on the Baltic, as also Greenland and other localities far to the north. Mr. Hewitson gives a most interesting account of his discovery of its nest i\\u00bb Norway : \\u2014 \\\" We had visited numerous islands with little encouragemerand were about to land upon a flat rock, when our attention was attractet by the singular cry of a Turnstone. We remained in the boat a short tims until we had watched it behind a tuft of grass, near which after a minute search, we succeeded in finding the nest. It was placed against a ledge <x. the rock, and consisted of nothing more than the dropping leaves of the Juniper bush, under a creeping branch of which the eggs, four in number, were snugly concealed and sheltered.\\\" Several other nests were also found in the course of further researches, which, however, were required to be both close and systematic. The eggs are of an olive-green colour, spotted and streaked with different shades of red-brown, and \\\" all having a beautiful tint of purple or crimson, seen in few other eggs.'' 171. SANDERLING. It breeds in Greenland, Labrador and other Arctic countries. It makes its nest on marshy grounds, of grass, and lays four \\\" dusky- coloured eggs, spotted with black.\\\" But little seems to be known of either the nidification or the eggs of this species, as no figure is given by either Mr. Hewitson or in the Reverend O. Morris's book. 237. HOOPER. Occasionally met with during the breeding season in Iceland, and more commonly in Lapland. They are described as inhabiting the most remote and inaccessible lakes and morasses in forest districts. The nest is made of any coarse water herbage which is suitable and at the same time accessible. It is large, and raised some inches above the surface of the supporting soil. The eggs are believed to be from three or four to seven in number, and are usually of a uale brownish white colour, extending to about 4 inches long by 2J broad. 245. PINTAIL. This Duck breeds in Iceland, and commonly in Lapland and some of the iistricts about the Gulf of Bothnia. It builds, like most others of its kind APPENDIX. 175 among the thick herbage commonly growing near the edge of pieces of fresh water; the nest being made of tlie same, but dry, and lined with down. The eggs are six to eight or nine in number, and are of a light greenish white colour, and about the same size as those of the Wild Duck proper. 265. VELVET SCOTER. This Sea Duck is found in Russia, Norway, the Faroe Islands, and also in Iceland. Mr. Audubon's account of its nest and eggs is as follows :\\u2014 \\\" The nests are placed within a few feet of the borders of small lakes, a mile or two from the sea, and usually under the low boughs of the bushes, of the twigs if which, with mosses and various plants matted together, they are formed f hey are large and almost flat, several inches thick, with some feathers of the female, but no down, under the eggs, which are usually six in number, 2J inches in length, by If in breadth, of an uniform pale cream colour, tinged with green.\\\" 256, COMMON SCOTER. It breeds, but not very numerously, in Iceland ; but is seen nesting in company with the Velvet Scoter, in Scandinavia, rather more commonly. It makes a nest of any available vegetable substance, such as grasses, twigs, leaves, dry stalks ; it is lined with down, and placed under the partial cover or concealment afforded by low shrubs or other plants. The eggs are six or seven to ten in number, of a pale buff colour slightly tinged with green, 2i inches long by If broad. After the eggs are laid, the males aseemble in large flocks and draw towairds the coast. 259. POCHARD. The breeding-haunt of this bird seems to be more to the eastward than the mojority of those hitherto named. It is said to be abundant in Russia and in the north of Germany, and is very commonly found in the Fur-countries in America during the breeding-season. A few also breed on the Borders of the Meres in Holland. The nest is similar in site and materials to those of the Wild Duck and other Ducks, and the eggs sometimes reach the nimaber of twelve. They are of a greenish buff colour, 2 inches in length, by H in breadth. The Pochard was discovered, several years since 176 APPENDIX as breeding about the mere at Scarborough, and has also been stated to nest occasionally in one or two places in Tforfolk. 281. SCAUP DUCK. This Duck has also been known as breeding very incidentally in this coun\\u00ab. try, but its almost unbroken habit is to return to such countries as Iceland, the swampy lake-district north of the GiJf of Bothnia, and some parts of Norway, for nesting purposes. It sometimes makes its nest in wliat may be almost called the usual site for the nests of Ducks, and sometimes upon the stones and shinglo at the edge of sheets of fresh water. The nest is very thin and slightly formed, but well lined with down, and the eggs seem to be six, seven, or eight in number, They are of a pal 3 bulT colour, and sensibly less in size than those of the Pochard last named. 262. TUPTED DUCK. This little Duck is known to breed near the head of the Bothnian Gulf, as well as in oth er parts of Sweden, and in Lapland and Russia. A few pairs also are seen nesting in Holland. It makes a very slight nest of grasses and the like. The eggs are seven or eight to ten in number, very similar in shade to those of the Scaup Duck last mentioned, but much less in size, being only a little over 2 inches long, by less than 1\\\\ in breadth. 263. LONG-TAILED DUCK. It is known to breed in Iceland, and believed to do so in Norway. It makes its nest among low brushwoou and the herbage usual at or near tho margin of fresh water. A few stems of grass Ibrm the substructure, on which is placed a plentiful lining of down. The eggs are from six to twelve in number. They art of yellowish-white, just tinged with green, and nearly 2| inches long by IJ in breadth. 265. GOLDEN EYE. This Duck seems to prefer wooded or forest districts for nesting in. It breeds in Lapland, Sweden and Norway, and has such a strong liking for a hole in a tree to nest in, that if suitable boxes with an adequate entrance- AJr'PENUIX. 177 hole are placed <ai the trees growing on the banks of streams or lakes frequented by them, their eggs are su ro io be deposited therein, to the great profit of those who suspend theboxes. Of course when it isknowu that aDuck hatches its young in a hole in a tree, the question must suggest itself\\u2014 as it did to the original obserrer in the ease of the Wild Ducks' nest on a pollard, or in a Fir-tree \\u2014 How can the young Ducks ever be got down safely, and still more, finally launched on their proper element ? An observed habit of the Golden Eye answers this question. A Lap clergyman saw the parent bird conveying its young, to the number of five or more, but one at a time, from the nest to the water, and he was at last able to \\\" make out that the young bird was held under the bill, but supported by the neck of the parent.\\\" The eicgs of the Golden Eye are said to be ten or twelve or oven more in number, Hiid of a brighter colour than is usual with the eggs of the Duck tribe, being of a rather decided green colour. 267. SMEW. But little that is quite authentic seems to be known of the nesting habits of this little Duuk; nor is it certainly ascertained where its chief numbers retire to breed. The esgs are said to be eight or ten in number, or even more than that, and to be of a yellowish white colour. 270. GREAT NORTHERN DIVER. This bird breeds on the Faroe Islands, and on some of the lakes in Iceland ; as also on some of the islands of Finmark. Spitzbergen and Greenland are also named as the breeding resort of many of these Divers. They lay, it is supposed, two eggs each, though in some observed instances only one was to be seen. Mr. Audubon says that three are sometimes laid. They are of a dark olive-brown, with a few spota of dark umber brown, and are of considerable size \\u00a3S3. LITTLE A^JK, This little wave-dwclIer has its nesting home in countries far more r.o tho North than ours. It abounds on some parts cf the Greenland shores, and it is also met with but much more sparingly, iu Iceland. It makes no nest\\u00bb M ilS ArPENDlX. but lays its one egg on the ground amongst or possibly beneath the large rock-masses which encumber the shore after falling from the overhanging cliffs and precipices. The parent birds are exceedingly averse to leave theii egg when incubation has commenced, and like some other species already mentioned, will rather suffer themselves to be removed by the hand. Tha egg is white lightly tinged with blue, a little spotted and veined with rual colour. INDEX. Accentor, Alpine, 63. Auk Little, 155. Great, 15fi. Bivoeet, 125. Bee-Eater, 98. Blackbird, 51.

MOORE'S BRITISH FERNS. With Coloured Plates. scU\\\" PREFACE. TuE object proposed in this volume is, in the first place, to present our young readers with a complete and systematic list of oui Britisli Birds : \\u2014 the word British being taken to mean such aSj being truly wild birds, either inhabit Britain throughout the year^ visit Britain statedly for longer or shorter periods of each year, or have been proved to reach the shores of Britain two or three times or oftener, under the pressure of any incidental circumstances whatever. In the next place, the attempt has been made to distmguisli at once between the rare or casual visitors, and such as are really denizens of the Land, whether for a few weeks or months aimualiy, or by unbroken habitation. But the principal object and intention of the book is to present Qoonooa PREFACE, accurate and trustworthy accounts of the Nests and Nesting-sites the Eggs, and any ascertained nesting or breeding-season peculiarities of every undoubtedly British-breeding species. And thb author's difficulty has often been out of the large mass of available materials at his command, acquired by personal observation or from the reading and notes of many years, to select what might be instructive, interesting or amusing, without bm-dening the book with unnecessary details, or encroachmg too much on the allotted space. The principle adopted in the illustrations has been to omit all representations of eggs either white or nearly white in colour-, in order to husband space for the admission ot a greater number of those characterised by varied colours and marldngs. On the same ground, although it was earnestly desired by the artist to give more than one representation of some of the very marked variations occurring in the eggs of several species, he has been compelled to content himself with selecting and figuring the most typical or normal forms in all such cases. AH the illustrations given have be^ carefully drawn from unquestionable specimens, and Mr. Coleman desires to acknowledge in this place the assistance, which in this matter, has been afforded him by that excellent and accurate practical naturalist, Mr. Y. Bond. PREFACE. VU An Appendix is subjoined, in wluch a notice will be found of the habits of nidification, the nests and eggs of several birds, which though regular inhabitants of Britain or soiiie part of it, for a given portion of each year, still retire to foreign and distant localities for the purposes of nest-making and rearing their young. Finally, an attempt has been made to exhibit at one glance, and iu a very condensed and systematic form, as much information as possible touching the nest, its customary site and materials, and also the eggs, their number, colour, and markings, and any noteworthy breeding peculiarities of each separate British-breeding species.. ] t is hoped this attempt, somewhat novel as it is, and almost inevitably imperfect as it must be in some respects, will not be regarded as altogether unacceptable by the youthful nest-hunter and egg-coUector. The author has only to obseiTc, in conclusion, that he has scarcely thought it necessary in the majority of instances to notice the common and well recognised fact that the particular species under notice, iu common with many or most of our common British Birds, rears two broods, or even more, in the course of the summer. Neither has he thought it requisite to attempt to PREFACE define the average season for the commencement of nidificatlon in the case of this or that species, as they came successively under review. INTRODUCTORY CHAPTERS. ClIAPTEE I. TuE object with wliich this book is written is tliat it may be interesting and useful to young egg-collectors. It is not easy to make a book, which is to be devoted to such details as the length and breadth and sliadcs and markings of some two or three hundred different eggs, eitlier interesting, or even barely readable. But there is no necessity that a book of British birds' eggs and nests should be devoted to merely such details as those. For my own part, 1 do not find it easy altogether to dissociate the eggs laid from tlie bird which lays them ; and when I see a beautiful nest, I can hardly help being led to think something about the builder, its means, objects, powers, instincts and intelligence. And I don't see why a book about eggs and nests should not follow the direction given by those same objects to my thoughts, and the thoughts of hundreds and thousands of other men besides me, and I am sui-e too ol hundreds and thousands of boys and girls as well. I am as sui-e as if I could see into the minds of many and many a young nest-hunter, that when he finds one day the wonderfully neat and beautiful Chaiiinch's or Goldfinch's or Crested Wren's nest, and the ncAt, lights upon some littering Jackdaw's nest, or B 2 BRITISH BIRDS, THEIR EGGS AND KES7S. inartistic, careless-seeming Jay's or E-iiig-dove's, that the wide, wonderful contrast and diiference sets him thinking \\u2014 What is the reason of this strange dissimilarity ? Is one of these birds really less clever than the other ? Did God make one of them a careless, disorderly, unthrifty bird, while the other He mado such a wonderfully neat and dexterous and contriving one ? And I am equally sure that a little measui-e of observation and thought wUl be enough to show the young inquirer not only that the Great Maker of Birds and Giver of their instincts and imderstandings and capacities has not left some of His creatures imperfect in some of their qualifications and endowments, but that the very contrasts and unlikenesses which first set liim on questioning at all, all teach one great lesson and illustrate one great truth, \\u2014 namely this, \\\" Lord, how manifold are Thy works ! In wisdom hast Thou made them all.\\\" Perhaps an Egg-book might be so written as to help such thought and observation as is here supposed, and now and then besides to suggest explanations or lead to investigation or commumcate a knowledge of facts such as to illustrate and make cleai, and even entertaining or amusing, the every day incidents and facts which fall commonly enough beneath the notice of the moderately sharp-eyed and observant nest-hunter. The difficulty of making such a book useful to the systematic collector of eggs, however yoimg, is not nearly as great as that of making it interesting to the many, who, tliough not inspired with the ambition of owning a real grand cabinet, and of arranging its manifold drawers with neatly ordered and ticketed egg-cards, are yet sensible of a real pleasure and enjoyment in noticing the nests and eggs of their numerous \\\"feathered friends,\\\" and identifying such as may chance to be less familiarly known than the majority of those met with under ordinary INTRODUCTORY CHAPTERS. 3 circumstances. Faithful description and accurate representation are clearly witliin oiu' reach, and such description and representa\\u00bb tion are sufficient in nineteen cases out of twenty for the purposes of identification in all instances of usual occurrence. The cases in which identification is difficult are of two or ibree kinds. Sometunes the difficulty arises from the near resemblance of the eggs laid by different allied species, sometimes rroni the wide discrepancies in the markings and especially in the sliadiugs or tints of eggs laid by the same species ; but much more frequently from the doubtful eggs being met with apart from the containing nests, or from want of proper or sufficiently accurate observation of the nests at the moment of discovery. The young egg-fancier should always recollect that the fashion and materials and site of the nest taken in connection with the eggs will almost always, with the aid of a tolerably accurate and well illustrated Book of Eggs, enable him to decide without hesitation as to the real owner of the nests and eggs in question ; while there are very many eggs, such as the Common Wren's, those of one or more of the Tom-tits, the Lesser Willow-Wren &c., of which specimens may be found so nearly resembling one another in shade and size and spots, that it requires a very nice and experienced eye to allot the several eggs to their certain origin. In such a case as this, recoui'se must be had to some kind and experienced Oologist. A few words on another subject. The author has been gravely taken to task by some of his conscientious friends, for delineating in one or two of his former books the pleasures and excitements of egg-hunting, or the satisfaction of trying to form a methodical collection. He has been more than once asked \\u2014 Do you really mean to encourage boys in robbing birds' nests ? Can fou defend such a practice from the charge of cruelty P 4 BRITISH BIRDS, THEIR EGGS AND MESTS. If I thought there was any real or necessary connection between a love of egg-hunting \\u2014 yes, and egg-collecting, too, \\u2014 and cruelt3', 1 would not say another word for it or about it. But I am sure that the real lover of birds and their nests and eggs is not the boy who is chargeable with those torn and ruined nests \\u2014 \\\" destroyed \\\" as they may well be styled \\u2014 which grieve one as he walks along tlie lanes and hedge sides. If the nest is taken, or rudely and roughly handled, or tlie eggs aU plundered, there is cruelty : for in the one case, the poor parent-birds are warned by their instinct, if not their intelligence, to forsake their treasured charge ; in the other, they suffer from pitiless robbery of what they most love. But if the parent bird be not rudely and repeatedly driven from her nest, \\u2014 if the nest be not pidled out of shape, or the containing bushes or environing shelter be not wilfully or carelessly disturbed \\u2014 if two or three eggs are still left for her to incubate, there is, so far as human observation can reach, no pain, or concern, or uneasiness, to the little owners from the abstraction of one egg or more, and, therefore, of course, no cruelty in the abstraction. The legitimate pursuit of sport in the stubbles and turnip fields, or on the open moor, does not differ more widely from the cruel proceedings of tlie cold-blooded, hard-hearted slaughterer of his dozens of Rock-birds (many of which are always left to die lingeringly and miserably), than the object or manner of action of the true lover of birds and their ways and nests tjid eggs, trom the rutliless destruction of every nest and its contents which may happen to be met with by some young loutish country savage. Again, a few words more, and this time about ciassificatiora. I should like, if such a course were profitable, or even practicable, to make just such a classification as an active, sharp-eyed^ observant, persevering nest-hunter would, %s it were, find ready- INTKOUUCTOia CllAl'TERS. 5 made for liiin, by the results of his rambles and investigations and discoveries ; tliat is to say, to group the birds and their ep;gs according to their frequent occinTence, their comparative, but still not positive, iufrequency, or their downriglit rarity. By this means, ana the subdivisions which would be suggested by an enumeration oi the most usual sites of the several nests, an interesting, and at least partially instructive as well as good, system of classification would be devised. But I am afraid such a system would not have much to recommend it, besides its novelty and interest and practical hints \\\" where to look for this bird's nest or the other's ; and how to look so as to find.\\\" One great disadvantage would be that such classification, so called, would have the effect of brealdng up groups which uatui-e lias put together. There is, generally speaking, what may be called a great family-likeness between the eggs of the various species of any given genus, or kind of birds. Take the Buntings, for instance : any one who is familiar with the common YeUow-Hammer's egg would at once guess at the eggs of either of the other species as belonging to a Bunting ; and the same of the Titmice, Linnets, Thrushes, Crows, and so on without end. So that although it may seem at first sight that scientific classification is hard and troublesome and half umiecessary, and may often prompt the question in the boy-collector's mind. Why wouldn't it do just as well to write down the English names on the cards and in my catalogue, and arrange them all my own way ? still it should be remembered that such classification after all is far from arbitrary, and on the contrary, and as far as it is really good, only follows out the teachings or guidings of nature. And this quite independently of the trouble which is saved by it to any one who wishes to consult books of reference, and still more to examine large and well-arranged collections of eggs, whether 6 BRITISH BIRDS, TUEIR EGGS A.ND NESTS. for his own direct instruction, or merely in searcii of interesting pastime. If a boy only knows that a Reed-Sparrow is called a Reed-Sparrow or a Black-headed Bunting, and he wanted to find the Reed-sparrow's eggs in a well-stocked collection, he might be half-an-hour before he lit upon what he wanted ; but if he knew that the generic name of the Bunting was Emberiza, and the specific name of the Reed-Sparrow, Schoeniclus, he would be able to pitch upon his quarry in half-a-minute. Besides all which, no one was ever the worse for learning habits of orderly and systematic arrangement, even though he had to pay the price of doing a little puzzling head-achy work, and liad to bother himself with a good many ugly-looking, ill-souuding, jaw-cracking words, such as Coccothraustes, Troglodytes, Platyrhynca, Phalacrocorax, and the like. It is proposed in this little book to adopt a classification which seems to meet with very general acceptance or acquiescence, and principally for that reason ; \\u2014 that, namely, which was employed by the late Mr. TarreU. This classification depends on the system which divides all birds whatever into five great classes, viz : \\u2014 I. Raptores Prey-catchers. II. Insessores Perchers. III. Rasores Scratciiers. IV. Grallatores .... Waders, V. Natatores .... Swimmers. Kach of these classes, or \\\"Orders,\\\" as they are technically called, is again divided either into distinct Pamilies, or (at least in some cases) into Sub-classes, or Groups ; these Groups being then further subdivided into Famihcs. Again, these Families are made up of more or fewer genera, and each genus of more or INTRODUCTORY ClIAPTJiRS. 7 Tewer species. These species, so many of tliem as compose any particular genus, all differ from one another more or less, but yet have a strong general resemblance, or (what may familiarly be called) strong family likeness to each other. The general scheme or, as I may almost call it, the skeleton o\\u00a3 our classification will therefore stand thus : \\u2014 ORDER I.\\u2014 R^\\\\rTORES. Family I. Vulluridce'^ . . . Vulture-kind.

This I have tried to convev in the annexed translation. It ouj,'ht to be observed also that the Bird whose name is given to the entire Family is selected for such purpose as possessing the characteristic qualities or peculiarities of the family in question, or, at least, most of them, in the strongest and most marked degree. t SylviadcB I have translated Wood-bird-kind, because Sylvia means something connected with wood, if it means anything. Sylvia is taken, in Bird-nomenclature, to denote a Warbler; and it may be said, that most of those birds whLch come under this division are Warblers in some sense, and are. in some degree or other, of sylvan habits; at least if wo give to tha word sylvan some latitude of meaning.

CHAPTEll 11. Any one who is conversant with Yarrell's admirable \\\" British Bu-ds,\\\" will most likely have noticed that that author givea in almost every case very precise measurements of the eggs of each particular species of Bird described. And it might, at first sight, seem to be so necessary to give such measurements that one would very likely feci half inclined to pronounce a Book of Birds' Eggs very imperfect, whicii omitted all notice of dimensions. But tlic fact is, such measurements are, in so very many different instances, altogether fallacious and likely to mislead. Thus I.Ir. Yai-rell's measurements of the Blackbird's egg are, \\\" the lengtli one incli, two lines ; the breadth ten lines.\\\" That is no doubt a good average or approximate measurement, but I have Blackbirds' eggs before me wliicli vary between half a line, or -^^ of an inch, less, and a line, or ^\\\\ of an incii, more in length, and between half a line, more or less, in breadth. Again, I have two Starlings' eggs on my table, both taken from the same Pigeon-cote, in Essex; one of which is l-^^s iiicli long by |\\u00a7 inch broad; the other 1-^ inch long, and fg inch broad; while to tlie eye the latter is not much more than half as large as the former. Moreover, Mr. Yarrell's measurements for this bird's eggs are precisely the same as for those of the Blackbird, and not only not tallying with those of either of my eggs, but not even presenting a near approach to the medium dimensions. Great numbers of similar instances might be adduced, and 12 BRITISH lilKDS, TIIKIK EGGS AND NESTS. in connection with tlic very commonest birds. Even eggs irom tne same nest may continually be met with, presenting great disparity in bulK ; one in the number being frequently so small in comparison with the others as to set one invariably thinking it must have been the last laid, and that a partial failure ol egg-producing power in the mother-bird must be the explanatioa of the phenomenon. It seems scarcely open to question that the physical condition of the parent-bird must exercise a great influence over its eggproducing capacity. Its powers may be impaired by age, by the past effects of injury or sickness, by a partial failure of some necessary element of food, by undue pressure on the egg-producing organs, such as m'lst occur by the loss of one or more early layings. Indeed all these causes are well-known to interfere with the reproductive energies of animals at large, and it is a thorouglily ascertained fact that both the first and the last act most strongly in the case of many Birds. The comparative size of Bii'ds' eggs, therefore, seems to me a matter to which it is unnecessary, if not inexpedient, to direct the young collector's attention; in any other way at least, than as to a matter of curious observation and contrast. As a means of identification it fails completely, and is only adverted to here for the purpose ol obviating a portion of the perplexity which may often occur in practice to the youthful egg-fancier from the difference in size between different specimens of what are in reality eggs of the same species of birds, but seem to him, from their discrepaucj of dimensions, not possibly so. Again, the colour and markings of many different species of eggs are found to admit of great variation. The most familiar and striking instance is in the case of the Guillemot: but one more within the reach of every nest-hunter is presented by tiie I.N'TEODUCTORY CnAPTERS. 13 eggs of the Blackbird. Sometimes the spots on them are verj minute and multitudinous ; almost confluent from their number and minuteness ; sometimes large and well defined and permitting the ground-shade of the shell to be very apparent ; sometimes reddisli in colour, closely approaeliing the shade of those on the Ring-Ousel's egg, and sometimes brown in hue, with no reddish tinge at all ; and sometimes they disappear altogether, or very nearly, and leave the egg with a strong resemblance to the littlftspotted Thrush's egg.* To such an extent is this the case, that a year or two since I was misled into assuming that four eggs which I found in a nest with all the characters of a Blackbird's nest, must most certainly from their colour and markings, be assigned to a Thrush original and not to a Blackbird. Other familiar instances of the same kind may be noticed as met with in the eggs of the House-Sparrow, tlie Tree-Pipit, tlie Sky-Lark, the Yellow-Haramer, one or more of the Hawks, &c. In the fabric and materials of nests, again, as constructed by birds of tlie same species, much dissimilarity, under peculiar circumstances, will be found to prevail. But really not more than might have been looked for beforehand, if it were not that, in our asual way of thinking about birds and other animals, we lay so much stress upon Instinct, and do not so mucli as admit t>D our notice the possibility that many of their actions may be prompted by a measure of intelligcncp, and not simply an unconsidering, unreasoning influence, which we term their Instinctive endowment. No doubt Instinct teaches them both to buUd and how to build their nests, and what materials are the most suitable, and the sites that are most eligible. But it is scarcely Instinct which sets the Eagle and the Crow, wflen tneir abode ia in a place that does not furnish the sticks they commonly \\u2022 i'arrell, i. 201. Ilewitson, L C3. 14 BRITISH BIRDS, TKEIR EGGS AND NESTS, or instinctively use for building their nests, to adopt instead of sticks the sea-weed stems which their home does produce. And so too of the House-Sparrow, which builds a huge domed or well covered-in nest, if it selects a tree or ivy for its site, but only lines the bottom of the hole in thatch, or a wall, with abundant feathers or hair or straw. The Wren, again, which usually builds its nest so that it may easily be removed entii'e and compact, may be found to avail itself of such a site for its nest, that it may be built on the principle of application \\u2014 like the Martin's to the wall beneath the eaves \\u2014 so that, when taken from its site, it shall appear to have had a segment completely cut out or sliced oiT from it. The adaptation of materials to site also, so as to secure a greater degree of concealment by making the intrusive structure assimilate in external fabric and hue to tlie surrounding objects, is well worthy of noticing attention, as supplying not only fresh sources of seeming unlikeness in nests of the same species of birds, but also fresh instances of the little feathered architect's wonderful adaptive iuteUigeuce. The question, \\u2014 Why are Birds' Eggs, iu so many cases, so variously and beautifully ornamented? Why are their hues and markmgs made so attractive to look at ? has ofteu been asked, and two or tliree difi'ereut answers or modes of answer have been suggested. I have seen the idea started that the design of such various colouring and marking is intended to facilitate concealment, by the adaptation of the general hue of the egg to that of the recipient or supporting substances. The theoiy is at least original and amusing ; but unfortunately less happy than when applied to the plumage of the bu-ds themselves which lay the eggs. It is no easy thing to detect a Partridge as she sits, lifeless-seeming, amid other objects not more still than herself. INTRODUCTORY CUAFTERS. 15 and presenting no great contrast in colour to her feathers : but there is no difficulty in seeing her eggs as they lie in the nest. And so well aware is she of the fact, that she always covers her eggs with some convenient and suit able material \\u2014 last year's oak leaves, for example \\u2014 when leaving her nest deliberately, or not under the impulses of alarm. The Hedge-Sparrow's eggs again, or any other blue egg, how can they be supposed to become less conspicuous by their colour when reposing in some earth-brown or hay-coloured nest-cup ? If it had been said that the Golden Plover's eggs, the Peewit's, tne Snipe's, the Norfolk Plover's \\u2014 not to name many others of which the same might be alleged \\u2014 were of such general hue, so shaded and so marked as to be anything but conspicuous, as to be indeed well calculated to escape any but a most scrutinising notice, in the apologies for nests which usually contain them, the entire truth of the remark would have appealed to every nest-finder's experience and assent : but it will not do so in any other form. It is impossible to lay down any rule for the coloui-s of eggs in connection with the places, or nature of the places, in which they are laid. \\\"White eggs are not laid in nests buUt in dark holes as a rule \\u2014 indeed, very much the contrary ; witness the Dove's eggs, and so many of those of the Duck tribe; nor are dark-colom-cd eggs invariably found to be laid where exposed to the greatest amount of broad dayliglit. There seems to be no rule in the matter. Again, another answer to the question just noticed is, Eggs were made so beautiful, and so vatious in their beauty, to gratify and gladden man's eye. I don't dispute the fact that the beautiful shape, and the beautiful tints, and the beautiful markings do gratify and gladden the human ey< and human heart too. I 16 BlUTISII BIKD8, TIIEIK EGGS AND NESTS. kuou they do, and in thousands of cases, and with a great, pure pleasure. But that is a very different thing from saying tlial God made them so for no other reason, or even for that purpose as a principal reason. How many thousands of eggs, for ten that are seen by man, escape all human notice whatever ! How many millions upon millions in the old-world times before there were men to see them, must have had their fair colours, and delicate synmietry, and harmonious interminglmg of hues, for no purpose whatever according to this view ! No, no. Nature siiould not be read so. God made tJie Beasts of the Field, and the Birds of tlie Air, and the Fishes of the Sea, and the Insects, and the Shells, and the Trees, and Herbs, and Flowers, ail, as a rule, wonderfully, gloriously, harmoniously beautiful, because He is a God of order, and beauty, and harmony ; because it would liave been inconsistent with His own Being, with the necessary purposes of such a Being, with the declared objects of such a Being in Creation, TiOt to have made all \\\" very good ;\\\" and the same reason which accounts for the beauty of tlie myriad flowers \\\" born to blush unseen,\\\" for that of the imiumerable shells and insects of past days and the present day, for that of the glorious birds of Tropic lands, is all that we want in the way of explanation of the symmetry and beauty of the Bird's Egg \\u2014 God made it as well as all other things \\\" very good.\\\" Something more to the point for the practical egg-hunter, and even although he may be not very juvenile, is to recommend the practice of jotting do-s\\\\Ti notes of any peculiarity of either nest or eggs or behaviour of parent birds, in any supposable case a little unusual. Such notes are always interesting and very often useful at some long subsequent period; useful in themselves, and useful too as commenting on or else illustrated by, the sinular memoranda of other observers. Besides, what is put down upon IXTKODUCTOKY CHAPTERS. 17 paper while the incident is still fresh, and the memory of it not Interfered with by other and newer matters of strong interest, the record is sme to be accurate ; wlule mere recollection at a later date is about sure to be insufficient or untrustworthy. Perhaps the boy-collector too may not thuik a few sentences about blowing and drying and mounting his egg-treasures either tiresome or uunecessary. As a niJe, let the egg intended to be kept be blown and dried as soon as possible. There are several reasons for tliis piece of advice. The light shells travel more safely than the full ef;g;; the egg-shells do not suffer detriment from lying overlooked with their contents rotting within, as often happens with the collector of un-careful and un-precise habits ; they are put into a state of comparative readiness for prompt and complete preparation and arrangement ; and though last not least, a good, useful, methodical habit is eucouraged in the collector himself. There are several ways of blowing an egg and going tlirougb the preparatory stages of fitting it to take its place m a collection. There are also instruments for extracting the contents of the shell so as to obviate the necessity of makiug more than one hole. I don't think they are likely to be of much use to a mere boy. 1 am sure they would be a great deal of trouble, and I don't think that the end gained would repay the trouble and care expended, I have always found a small hole, only just large enough to admit the passage of sufficient air to expel the contents, made very carefully and neatly at the small end, and a larger one about half-way between the great end and the line of greatest diameter, which need not be more than a line in breadth for the very largest eggs (if not \\\"hard-sat,\\\") quite sufficient for my purpose, and not objectionable on the score of disfiguring the shell ; for by mounting the egg with the larger or vent hole, downwards \\u2014 the smaller hole being 18 bhitisu birds, tiieui eggs and nests. practically invisible in a great number of instances, at least until looked for \\u2014 it appears to be altogether entire and perfect. Any tolerably strong pin will da for the purpose with small eggs. For the larger and harder shells something more efficient win be required. A hard steel instrument fashioned like a \\\" glo \\u25a0 ver's needle\\\" \\u2014 that is with the penetrating end furnished with three edges all lost in the point \\u2014 is as good as any thing that could be devised, and by liaving two or three of different sizes, every case of necessity would bo provided for. The sharp-pointed pen-blade may be employed, but great care is necessary lest, when the perforation is just effected, the instrument slip a little further in than was intended, and an ugly fragment of shell be wrenched out. When the e^g is thoroughly blown, it is advisable to draw up a little clean water into it by the process of immersing tlie vent hole and sucking or drawing in the air from the shell with the mouth through the other\\u2014 just reversing the late process of \\\" blowing\\\" in sliort. The shell, when half-full, should be weh shaken, and the water then expelled as the legitimate contents had been : a very gentle puff will suffice for this. Hepeat the process two or three times, or until the water comes out as clear as it went in ; then dry the egg as weU as you can by blowing through it at intervals, after it has been so held that the moisture on the inside may all trickle down towards the vent-hole ; after which it may be set up for some hours in an airy, but not sunny, place to dry thoroughly. Some collectors varnish their eggs. A little of the white of the egg itself is all-sufficient, and that should not be applied unless the egg is perfectly clean, which is by no means the case with the eggs of many groundbuilding birds when taken from the nest. I have taken Dabchicks' eggs also so completely muddied all over, that it was IXTRCD'JCTOKY C HATTERS. I'J slmost impossible to get tliem clean. One, met with on one of (he Efesex marshes a year or two since, which was the only one yet laid and apparently not a day old, was so engrained with dirt or mud that it defied all efforts to restore it to its pristine whiteness. In tlie case of an originally white egg, such clTorts will not do much liarm ; in the case of an egg strongly mai-ke.d with deep colours, it is a different matter. The eflorts to remove the clay or dirt imparted by the feet of the parent bird may succeed in removing the stains in question, but mny also very likely remove some of the tmts or stronger colouring too. It must be rem.embered that the deeper colours of many eggs are not \\\" fast,\\\" at all events when they have not been long laid, and that attempts at cleansing, more vigorous than judicious, may easDy produce an undesired result. If the vent-hole is necessarily made large, there is no objection to placing a piece of thin or gauze paper, wetted with the varnish or white of the egg, so as to cover the entire orifice, and so exclude dust or other intrusive substances. As to mounting the eggs, and labelling for insertion in the collection, much depends on taste. An ordiimry \\\"printer's\\\" card is as good for the purpose as anything, and a little very strong gum-water is the only other requisite. A little attention to placmg the eggs symmetrically and neatly, and the use of a few gun- wads or halfpence or small wooden wedges, to retain the eggs, when accurately set in their true position, until the gum has had time to narden, are matters which will almost sm-ely suggest themselves to any youthful egg-fancier Avho is only tolerably given to admire the \\\"simplex mimditiis.\\\" As for labels, they may either be neatly written, or procured, at a very light cost, printed on pui-posa lor such application. BRITISH BIRDS THEIR EGGS AND NESTS. la the following pages I shall endeavour, as far as my subject will permit, to avoid mere dry aad uninteresting detail. It is, of course, quite inconsistent with the nature of tiie book to omit matter-of-fact descriptions altogether, or even in any very great degree; but an effort will be made to relieve the whole from wearing the appearance of a catalogue in disguise, and to give it as much of a life-like practical character as possible. How many incidents in a school-boy's life are connected, in his memory, with some nesting expedition, some recollection of, perhaps, an accidental discovery of a nest and eggs he had never seen before, or possibly wished and tried to find, but always wished and tried in vain. Such experiences are always pleasant and interesting in their detail to the real lover of birds and their belongings ; and often almost as much so when detailed by others as when reproduced in his own recollections of former days, and their Hopes, and plans, and successes, and disappointments, each often renewed, or often repeated under some rarying from. Why, then, should not such matters stand here and there in these pages? Our plan, therefore, will be to omit all special notice of the 22 BUITISII BIJLDS. TUEIR EGGS AND NhSTS. nests and eggs of so-called \\\"British BLi-ds,\\\" whose only claim to the designation lies in their having been met with once or twice or even some half-dozen times in the British Isles : to omit it, that is, in the body of the book, and to give such reference or description of at least the more interesting species and their eggs, as space may allow, in an Appendix. Accounts will be, however, given of the liabits of nidification and the eggs of all unquestionably British Birds, even although their breeding habitat be in another country, or most rarely and exceptionally within the compass of the British seas \\u2022 such birds, for instance, as the Fieldfare, the lledwing, the Snow-Bunting, and others, besides several of the Ancdidx. We begin, therefore, with our first Order, the \\u2014 RAPTOKES. FAMILY I.\\u2014 VULTUEID^. Two members of this Pamiiy, classed by some naturaUsts as belonging to the same genus, by others as species of two different genera, have been met with in Britain; but I believe one of them, the first-named below, only once, the other only twice or three times. They are only mentioned here as showing the justification there is for claiming the family of Vulturidx as being in anywise exemplified in birds belonging to the Britisb Isles. 1. GRIFFON VULTURE\\u2014 (r\\u00ab/^Kr/\\u00ab/r\\u00abi). 2. EGYPTIAN VULTURE\\u2014 (iVeo;5^ro\\u00ab percnopierus). FAMILY II.\\u2014 FALCONID.E. There are several species belongmg to tiiis Family of sufficiently common occurrence even still in these days of ganieprescrvcrs, ganie-kecpers, and vermin-killers. GOLDEN EAGLE. 23 Time was, and not so long since either, uhen many even of those most rare now, wore familiarly met with in almost all parts of the country; and Eagles and the Kite and several of the larger and more conspicuous Falcons and Hawks were not yet become so much like Black Swans, as they are now in so many English and even Scottish counties. Tliese birds diCfer, with a marked distinction, from those belonging to the Yulture-kind ; and as much in habits and food and power of whig as in appearance, formation, bill and claws, and other matters, such as the scientific naturalist notices for the purpose of enabling liimself and others to distinguish between Family and Family, genus and genus, species and species Thus, tlie Vulture's food is usually carrion ; the flesh of animals killed by other agency than their own, and in numberless instances in a state of putridity more or less complete. The food of tlie Falcon tribe generally consists of the flesh of creatures taken and killed by themselves. I say generally ; \\u2014 not invariably. The Eagles in a state of nature do not disdain to gorge themselves on the flesh of a dead sheep for instance, although they have had no hand \\u2014 or rather beak and claw \\u2014 in the death. StiU the rule is, and admitting not many exceptions when the whole family is considered, that the Falconidse hunt for, or surprise, and slay their prey for themselves. And very intent on this business are they oftentimes, when engaged in discussing the meal their craft or stiU vigilance, or fierce impetuous speed and dash has secured for them. Often, too, not a little sleepy and heavy are they after having been lucky enough to secure a large prey, and greedy enough to stuff themselves fuU with it. The bird which stands at the head of the family and alike deserves and does credit to his rank is the 24 IJKniSll lURDS, TIIEIU KbGS AM) NEMS. 3. GOLDEN EAGLE\\u2014 (Jfjmla ehrysaetos). It seems almost too tame to talk of an \\\" Eagle's nest,\\\" and we seem almost to feel as if different M'ords might well be applied to the nursery-structure of the King of Birds, and that of the tiny Tom-tit or the \\\"VYren. So, independently of the nice, simple, old meaning of the word eyry * which makes it so suitable as anrilied to the egg-liome of the grand kingly bii-ds, called Eagles, we feel a sort of satisfaction in limiting the use of the word eyry to the Eagle's nest alone. No easy matter is it always to cmtivate a visiting acquaintance with an Eagle. His home is not in a place easy of access to any but himself, or those, like himself, up-borne on wings. On rock platforms, not too scanty in size, in mountaLnous districts, and guarded by rugged, stern, precipitous rock-walls, utterly forbidding, in almost every case, access by human members from below, and not often to be safely reached from above, the great pile which forms the nest is usually built. Sometimes, but very rarely by comparison, it may be found on some large, possibly shattered, forest-trunk amid some wild, seldom-approached scene of loneliness or desolation. It is four to five feet in diameter, made of sticks of no mean size and length, sometimes lined with softer materials, sometimes not ; the new or more recently constructed nest placed upon those of last yeyr and other preceding years ; and would require a willing and able labourer to clear it thoroughly away, and no slight touch of the quality of the gate-bearing Jewish hero in the juvenile nestseeker who might aspire to carry off such a trophy of Jiis nesting \\u2022 Probably from Saxon Eghe (g soundod like y) an egg. The moder'n English form of tlie word would be \\\" Egirery \\\" tlierefore ; the old English form Eyry or Eyrie. Chauoei (about 1400) wrote ey for egg. GOLDEX EAGLE. 23 exploits. The site chosen for tlie nest-pile too is ahiiost inv;iri. ably one which commands a wide, unliindered look-out ; partly it is likely, under the influence of the strong instinct of vigilance in self-prcsorvation, partly also for the advantages offered by such a dwelling-place towards the detection of a distant prey. The number of eggs deposited is usually two, sometimes three. They are commonly of a dull whitish ground, mottled or marbled nearly or quite all over with a sort of rusty hue. The young ones, while yet too young to leave the nest, are amply catered for by their parents. Lists are sometimes given of the spoils, feathered and four-footed, found m what may be styled the Eagle's larder \\u2014 Black Game, Moor Game, Partridges, Hares, Rabbits, Lambs, young Roes, and so on, to an amount that would seem hardly credible to one not conversant with the Eagle's power of vision and mighty sweep of wing. Indeed there is a story told of a man in L-eland who got a fair provision for his family in a season of scarcity by no other effort than was requisite in plundering an Eagle's nest of the food brought in by the parent birds for their young. He is said also to have prolonged the season of supply by preventing the young ones from flying, by clipping their wings as the feathers grew. Instances have oeen known where the prey seized was human. Professor Wilson tells a touching story, in a touching way, of an incident of the kind, in which the infant was seized as it lay and slept where its mother had placed it, while herself busy not far off in the harvest field, and carried off by the strong bird to its eyry. Tlie poor mother, frantic with her loss, blind to everything but tiie thought and effort for the recovery of her babe, safely scaled the precipice, liigh up on which the nest was placed; though no man, however skilful and expert as a cragsman, h.ad ever dared altemct the ascent ; found her babe 2'> iSUlTISII BIRDS, TIIEIB EGGS AND NESTS. alive and unhurt and smiling in her face, descended again \\u2014 a iiore perilous feat stUl \\u2014 in safety, and ouce more on level ground at the foot, swooned helplessly away. The Eagles did not attack her in reality, though their fierce menaces made the spectators tremble. Our boy readers if ever they found an Eagle's nest might well need the protection of a good strong cudgel, fearlessly and skilfully wielded, before they succeeded in possessmg themselves of one of its eggs. \\u2014 Fi^. 1, plate I. 4. WHITE-TAILED EAGLE.\\u2014 (ZTa/we^a* albicilla). Cidled also Erne, Cinereous Eagle, Sea Eagle. \\u2014 This species \\u2014 a member of another genus, however \\u2014 like the last, breeds amid high, almost inaccessible rocks, in the mountainous solitudes of Scotland, and some of the northernmost British Islands. The nest resembles the Golden Eagle's, but is often more cushioned \\u2014 one can hardly say lined, when there is scarcely any cavity or depression to receive the eggs \\u2014 more cushioned with soft material such as heather or sea-weed. This Eagle seldom lays more than two eggs, which in ground-colour are Like the Golden Eagle's, but not often noticeably marked with red- The White-tailed Eagle is much more frequently seen south of the Border than the Golden Eagle. In fact, a year rarely passes without some record of the occurrence of this fine bu-d in more than one county of England, and those by no means always the most northerly. On the rabbit waiTcns of Norfolk and Suifolk they are frequently met with, and it not seldom happens that two are seen together \\u2014 perhaps the young from the same nest driven forth by their stern parents to seek then- ovra. living in the wide worla. The male Eagle of this species is kiiowc, like the male of many 97 otner kinds of birds, to take his turn with his mate in incubating their eggs. It ^ouJd seem difficult for the observer to be mistaken iu this fact ; for the male bii-d, as is the case in the other families of the Falconidse generally, is very distinctly smaller than the female \\u2014 to the actual extent indeed of not niucn less than one-third cf the entii'e size. 5. SPOTTED EA.GL'E\\u2014iJquila ncevia). Met with in Britain, once or twice only. We come next to a Raptorial Bird, whose food is proouied mainly from the water, \\u2014 namely, the G. OSPREY \\u2014 (Pandlon halixeius). The Osprey, or Fisliing Hawk, or Mullet Hawk, or Eagle Fisher, * builds its nest sometimes on a tree, sometimes on some part of an ancient and deserted building \\u2014 always on the liighest part, a turret or chimney for instance \\u2014 and sometimes on a rock or precipitous scar. But a very favourite and almost characteristic site \\u2014 speaking of the bird only as a British bird \\u2014 is oa some lone insular rock in a wild mountain loch in Scotland. I extract a very striking description from \\\" St. John's Tour in Sutherland : \\\" \\\" The nest was placed in a most curious situation. About a hundred and fifty yards from the shore, there rose from the deep water a solitary rock, about ten feet high, shaped like a broken sugar-loaf or truncated cone. On the summit of this was the nest, a pile of sticks of very great depth, evidently the accumulation of many breeding seasons, as the Osprey returns year after year to the same nest. How this heap of sticks witbutood the winter gales without being blown at once into the water puzzled me. * * * The female Osprey allowed our boat to approach within two hundred yards or so, and thee \\u2022 A translation of the Gaelic uarae of the bird. 28 BKJTlSIi lilKDS, TlIEIll EGGS AND XKSTS. leaving her nest, sailed upwards with a circling flight, till she joined her mate high above U3. Having reached the rock, and with some difficulty ascended to the nest, our disappointment may be imagined when we found it empty. From the old bird having remained on so long, we had made sure of finding eggs in it. Tlie nest itself, however, was interesting to me, perched as it was on the very summit o'f tlie rock, and composed of large sticks, * every one of which must have been a heavy burden for a bird of the size of the Osprey. In the centre of the pile of sticks was a cup-shaped hoUow, the size of a boy's cap, lined with moss and dead grass, and apparently quite ready to rect-ive eggs.\\\" \\\"In another nest,\\\" says the same author, elsewhere, \\\"we found two beautiful eggs, of a roundisn shape : the colour white, with numerc^us spots and marks of a fine rich red brown.\\\" \\u2014 Fig. 2, 'plate I. The Osprey is met with from time to time in almost all parts of the kingdom, but more especially along the east coast ; but it is known to breed nowhere in England now. In America, it is met with in considerable numbers, forming as it were a large colony, during the breeding season; of course, in the vicinity of some ample and convenient fishing station. We come next to the Falcons, distinguished from the rest of the Hawks, by, among otlier things, their long and pointed wings, and their vehement and lapid HigLt and dash in pursuing and seizing their quarry. Fu'st we notice the 7. GYR FALCON.\\u2014 (i^a/co Grmnlandicus). Also called Jer Falcon and Greenland Falcon. \\u2022 Some of the sticks \\u2014 or rather branches\\u2014 employed, are said to be \\\\\\\\ inch in diameter. PEREGRINE FALCON. 29 8. ICELAND FALCON.\\u2014 (/a/co Islandlcus). Neither of these birds breed in Britain, and they are only occasional and somewhat rare visitants. Whatever notice can be afforded to them, will be met with in the Appendix. 9. PEREGRINE FAI.CON. {Falco perejrinus). There was a tin)e at which this bird was abundant enough in our island. It still breeds in many parts of both England and Scotland, though much more commonly in the latter country. But in the feudal times there would have been no difficulty to the young egg-collector \\u2014 if such beings existed then \\u2014 in meeting with the nest of the Peregrine, in districts suitable to their breeding habits and requirements. Although some consideration, it is true, might have been advisable previously to appropriating the contents of the said nest for cabinet purposes. The right iiand of the fortunate collector would have been the penalty in lliose days of strict game laws. So stringent, indeed, were the provisions for preserving the Peregrine, that the customary breeding haunt of a pair was placed under the especial care of the occupiers of the land in the immediate vicinity, and they were made responsible, by the terms of their tenure, for the safe keeping of the noble birds and their offspring. One such site is in Goathlaud, on the line of the Pickering and Whitby Railway, and it is an interesting fact in the nesting habits of the Peregrine, that until within a recent period (and it is believed at the present time also), KiHuig-nab Scar has always been a site of that Falcon's nidification. Many of its breeding places, perhaps Uke others in the interior, known time out of mind by some name derived from the circumstance of their being thus appropriated, such as Faicon-scar, Hawk-scar, Eagle-cliff, are among the tallest and least accessible rocks of the sea coast. The nest itself is placed on rome projection, possibly within some fissure, and is so BRITISH BIRDS, THEIR EGGS AND NESTS. made of sticks, or seaweed from the coast, and is lined with soinft hail- on whicii, for the hoUow is not deep, the eggs repose. These are from two to four in number, often vary a good deal in size (probably according to the age of the laying bird), and not less in the markings and mottlings whicli pervade the entire sui'face. A reference to the engraving will give a better idea of the colour and appearance of this beautiful egg, than any description. Indeed, description of many \\u2014 of most \\u2014 eggs fails altogether iu conveying an adequate idea of what they are like. These birds were so much prized in the middle ages on account of their fitness for the highly-esteemed pursuit of Falconry; and their power of wing and magnificent flight are in themselves matters of great interest, quite independently of the excitement of the chase. The female, from her much greater size and strength, was emphatically \\\"the Falcon;\\\" the male, called the Tercel, or Tiercel, being more frequently flown at much smaller game, as Partridges. A Falcon-flight \\u2014 although the science is no longer ciiltivatcd at Didlington, in Norfolk, as it was a few years since by the late owner of the estate \\u2014 may still, however, be seen, from time to time, by the fortunately-placed observer, both Hawk and quarry being ferae naturd. Some luckless GuU, or Guillemot, or Rock-Dove, is selected by the strong freebooter and carried off from amid the passing multitudes with a fierce, rushing dash ; and if there are young to be sustained, the onset aad sweep may possibly be seen once and again. \\u2014 Fig. 3, plate I. 10. l\\\\O^V>X\\u2014{Falco subbuteo.)

A little hollow iu the ground, and that usually not too conspicuous by the absence of ling in its vicinity, with scarcely any lining, receives the eggs, three to five in number, and characterised by the reddish hue and spottings which seem to garnish the eggs of almost all the true Falcons. The nest is said to be sometimes built in a tree, and then, from l&r. Doubleday's account, seems to be made of sticks, and lined with wool. The Merlin, or Blue Hawk as he is usually called here, IS not a rare bu'd on our North Riding moors ; and a very bold and active Hawk it is. \\u2014 Fig. 5, plate I. ] 3.

What nest-hunter has not often been warned by that well-known sound, as he came near some scarp of rocks, wood-beset, >\\\\'cll qualiflea to furnish some ledge or crevice to hold the loosely-compacted structure of sticks and wool which does duty for this dainty-looking Hawk's nest ? Yes ; and have not more than one or two of us taken tiie young, and reared them to be our pets, and taken no little pleasure in their beauty and personal pride and preening cares ?

Mice seem to form a favourite, if not staple, article of their food ; but they are cot exclusive in their diet. An occasional small bird, hosts of coleoptera or beetle-kind, cock-chafers in their season, grubs, and even worms, are known to be readily eaten by them. As intimated above, the species is everywhere familiar, and is alike too beautifid and too useful to be so wantonly killed as it too often is.- -Fiff. G, plaie I. 14. GOSHAWK\\u2014 (Jsiur palimbarius). We do not often see the Goshawk in any part of the kingdom, and very rarely indeed, except in some parts of Scotland and in Orkney. It, like the Peregrine, was in much request for the sport of Hawking : only, as its manner of flight was different from that of the Falcon, it was used for the pursuit of different species of game from the latter. Probably this really originated in the impulses of the Goshawk's own Instinct, which leads it to attack Hares and Rabbits, or birds which, like the Partridge and Grouse, never voluntarily fly at any great height above the level of the ground. One curious habit of this bii-d is that of waiting patiently imtil some bird, which it has driven to covert, leaves its shelter, when the pursuit \\u2014 after a pause of perhaps several hours \\u2014 is immediately resumed, and probably carried to its purposed result. Most of the other Hawks, when baffled in the way noticed, very speedily relinquish all apparent thought or recollection of the escaped creature, and proceed to seek for a fresh quarry. It builds its nest on some high tree; only the tree selected is never found in the inner and deep parts of the wood and forest. Like many other birds, both predatory and other, it will often return to the same nest, adding whatever rej'airs may be required, for several successive years. It lays three or four eggs, of a pale faint blue, quite untinged with any other colour. 3^ BRITISH BIRDS, THEIR EGGS AND NESTS. 15. STA'R'ROW-'RA.WK\\u2014CAccipaer Nisus.) Sometimes called Pigeon-Hawk. \\u2014 Another short-winged hawk, as the last named also was, but vastly more common and familiarly known. Some of the Falcons already named may be fitly called bold, or fearless ; the Sparrow-Hawk may be pronounced audacious, or impudent. If you hear some careful, Martha-like housewife of a hen skirling and fussing, in dire alarm, her terrified chicks, the -while^ seeking any possible shelter, you may DC almost certain that the gliding form you caught a glance of rounding the corner of the barn and making a rapid, but by no means noisy stoop, among the young poultry of various kinds in lively attendance on their mothers, \\u2014 you may be tolerably sure that the intruder was a Sparrow-Hawk, and that some hapless Dove or Chicken has lost the number of his mess. Not that he does not like wild game as well as tame poultry. Mr. Selby mentions one nest, containing five young ones, in or close to which were found a Peewit, two Blackbirds, a Thrush, and two Green-finches, aU fresh, and half plucked. The Sparrow-Hawk is believed seldom to give itself the trouble of building a nest for itself. Some old or deserted nest of the Crow or Magpie, particularly the former, and whether in a fork of the tree or liigh among its top, usually serves its turn ; and in this, very slightly repaired if at all, the mother bird lays four or five eggs, of a pale blueish white, abundantly and most variable blotched with dark red brown. In some few eggs tliis darker colour is more sparingly bestowed ; but they are not frequent, and, usually, the red is more or less confluent about some part of the egg \\u2014 either end or the middle \\u2014 more rarely dispersed in very distinct spots, \\u2014 Fig 7, plate I. 16. KITE \\u2014 (Milvus vulgaris) . Glead, Glade, Gled, Pork-tailed Kite or Glead, Puttock, Crotchet-tailed Puttock. COMMON BUZZARD. 35 One very rarely sees a Kite nowadays in our customary ield ramblings and observings; though, to be sure, some one did \\u25a0^\\\\T.-ite word not long since to the \\\" Zoologist,\\\" that he had seen one sailing overhead as he walked the streets of London. Perhaps any but rather resolute nest-hunters might say, if they knew the reception sometimes accorded by a Kite to a wouldbe plunderer of its nest, \\\"Well, the loss is not without its compensation.\\\" Eor the Kite fights fiercely for its eggs or young ; and has been known to inflict damage of both dress and person on a boy attempting to plunder its nest. It is a noblelooking bird; but not distinguished, as the Falcons are, for any very remarkable degree of boldness or courage. A fussy old hen has been known to frighten one from his purposed foray on her cliickens, and he used of old to be chased (for sport, of course) by a species of Palcon \\\" to the manner \\\" trained. The nest, usually found high-up in a high tree in thick wood or forest, is made of sticks and lined with any softer material found handy, and contains two or three eggs of a dii-ty white colour, with a few spots or blotchings of dull red. They cater liberally enough for their young ; no less than twenty-two Moles having been found in one nest. \\u2014 Fig. ], plate II. 17. SWALLOW-TAILED \\\"KlT^\\u2014CNauclerm furcatus).

I well remember as a schoolboy in Essex, some thirty odd years ago, that the nests of the Puttock, as the Buzzard was invariably called in that district, were more frequently found by us than those of any other wood-building Hawk ; and many a hatch of young Buttocks it fell to my lot to see brought within the old school-gates. Wliether the Buzzard is equally abundant there now 1 cannot tell. It seems to me that 86 BRITISH BIRDS, THEIR EGGS AND NESTS. not oiily Hawks, but very many of the smaller bii'ds as weli, we much less numerous now than in the days of my boyhood; and I have heard other nest-lovers make tlie same remark. In rocky countries the Buzzard sometimes builds her nest on precipices, or steep banks ; but generally, in our ovm country, some fork iu a tree supplies either the site for the intended nest, or possibly the nest itself; for, like several otlier of the Hawks already noticed, the Buzzard seems to think tliere is a deal of sound sense in the saying, \\\" Foolish birds build fine nests for wise Hawks to live in them,\\\" and acts accordingly. Tho eggs are from two to four in number, of considerable size, and some of them approaching veiy nearly in general look and colour to the Kite's egg. It just as frequently seems to wait until its prey comes to it, aa trouble itself to go far in search of it. It is rather a sluggard and a coward to have so much the air of a fineiooking bird about it. \\u2014 Fit/. 2, plaie IT. 19. ROUGH-LEGGED B^ZZARB\\u2014fBufeo lagopus).

The nest was a shallow one, composed of sticks, and lined with dead leaves of the beech. The number of eggs \\u2014 an illustration of which is f )ven \\u2014 seldom, exceeds two. \\u2014 Fig. 3, lAaie II. ASH-COLOURED HAJIXIIER, 37 21. MARSH UAJmiER\\u2014fCircus mfus). Moor Buzzard, Bald Buzzard, Marsh Hawk, Harpy, Whiteaeaded Harpy, Puttock, Duck-Hawk. \\u2014 One would hardly expect to find tliat a bird, with such a string of aliases to its name, could enjoy a very wholesome reputation. However, he's no worse than his fellows of the Hawk family, and not so bad as some of them. Probably the name of Harrier, given to this and one or two of the Hawks next named, is derived from their method of beating or quartering the ground, when in search of prey, putting one in mind of tlie evolutions of the hound similarly engaged. Tlie Marsh Harrier or Moor Buzzard (or Bald Buzzard, as I used to hear it called in Essex) builds its nest of flags or rushes \\u2014 sometimes sticks or twigs \\u2014 on the ground, amid the grass at the bottom of a fui'ze or other bush ; occasionally low in the bush itself; and again, in a tuft of reeds or rushes sufficient to serve the purposes of concealment. In it it deposits three or four eggs, white, or with only a tinge of milk blue about them. It feeds itself and its young with young water-birds, if it can meet with them \\u2014 and. its name suggests the idea that young water-birds may be met with where itself is found \\u2014 or young rabbits or birds ; a few mice and small rats doubtless not coming in as altogether unworthy of notice to such hungry customers as four young \\\" Harpies.\\\" 21. HEN -HARRIER\\u2014 ra?rK5 cyaneus). t don't give a list of country or locai names here, as usual, because I wish to draw my reader's attention to the fact, that the different names applied to the same species of Hawk, are, in several cases, partly attributable to the differences in size, and especially in plumage, dependant on sex and age in the cases in question. This is quite the case with the Harriers generally, and puriicularly with the bird new under notice. There is a 38 BRITISH BIRDS, THEIR EGGS AND NE3T!\\u00bb. remarkable difference in colour between the male and female when adidt, and a likeness when the former is immature and the latter an old bird. Thus, the old male is mainly blue, the female brown ; so he is called the Blue Hawk often, or Dove Hawk, and she the Ringtail. Like those of the Marsh Harrier, the eggs of the Hen Harrier are white, and are placed in a nest of small sticks and long, coarse grasses, built upon the ground, four or five in number, and not often varying from the uniform tint of the ground-colour by the addition of a few reddishcoloured spots or speckles. Its distinctive English name \\u2014 ZTijw-Harrier, seems to be due to the fact, that, like the sick and repentant old Fox, it appears often to consider \\\" a chicken might suit me too,\\\" and acts accordingly. But, from its habits of regularly working over stubbles and other haunts of the Partridge and other like birds, there is little doubt that it varies its diet with a little game occasionally. 23. ASH-COLOURED IIXRRIER\\u2014 {Circus cineraceus). Tills bird, for which YarreU proposed the name Montagu's Harrier, is by no means of frequent occurrence in this country, and is scarcely likely to be met with by many of our young readers. The nest, like those of the other two species of Circus just named, is usually on the ground, often not far from gorse or whin-bushes; and the eggs, four or five in number, are like those of its congeners in general colour and aj)pearance. With this bird our list of Falcorudse closes. FAMILY II.~STEIGID^. When I was a boy I remember \\u2014 only those goings-back to school were a sad hindrance \\u2014 trying or helping to make a colleo tion not of Bi-ds' eggs exactly, but of Bird's \\u2022merry-thouojhta MEANS OF FLIGHT IN THE OWl.. '62 Did our young readers ever see such a collection, or think of it ? Perhaps the answer will be \\\" No ; \\u2014 and if we had, what would it have to do with a book about Bu-ds' eggs ? \\\" I will try and show that I have a purpose in mentioning Bii'ds' merrythoughts, and that it may have something to do with such a book a5 this, and its subject. We have already agreed that classification is a useful and necessary thing ; tliat nature herself leads us to it, and shows ua how to fashion and contrive it ; nay, that the very eggs of bii'ds are, speaking generally, such in their shape and mai-kings as often to suggest the formaiion of a group out of such and such different species producing them. But the merry-thoughts and the bones they are immediately connected with, the keel-like breast bone and the side and wing bones,* will be found to do the same tiling, with respect to the collection of three or four (or more) such groups of birds, as I have just called them, into what is termed a Family. Thus, if our readers could get the opportunity of looking at the merry-thoughts and breast-bone\\\" of half-a-dozen different Hawks, they would find, with a degree of variation according to the various species selected, a very obvious and striking correspondence or resembiance. The breast-bone, in every case, would show great depth of keel and strength of substance ; and the merry -thoughts would be seen to be firm and strong, and of great or considerable substance Next, if the corresponding bones of about the same umnber of birds of the Owl-kind {Sirigidos), were taken and compared with taose of the Falcon-kind just spoken about, while the mutual \\u25a0'esembiance of the Owl-kind bones was seen to be quite as great and obvious as in the case of the Hawks ; the difference between l.he said bones of the Owls and those of the Hawks would be 1 don't {rive the scientilic names of these bones, for obvious reasons. 40 lUUTlSIl BIRDS, THEIR EGGS AND NESTS altogether strange and lialf startling, from its greatness and fcddenness. The deep keel and the strong substance of the '.rcast-bone in the Hawk has given place to a shallow keel and weak walls in the Owl, while the curved, strong, broad, solid merry-thought has become a fork with thin, straight, weak, yielding shanks. So great and plain is the difference that any sharp intelligent boy could almost dii-ectly pick out for himself all the Hawk bones, and all the Owl bones, and put them in their several groups. And if he did, I think he would say to himself, and most likely to some other person, as soon as he met with one likely to be able to answer hmi, Wliat does this difference in these bones of these birds of different Families mean ? \\u2014 In plain words, it means difference in powers of flight. Any of our school-boy readers who wanted to prise his strong school-box open, because he nad lost his key, would not take his peu-knife for the purpose ; because he would think it foolish to use so weak an instrument for so strong an effort. A great strong cliissel would be much more likely to serve his purpose. And so is the work of God's hand. If a long, strong wing has to be moved rapidly, and even vehemently, the motion, like all animal motion, must be given by muscles. But the muscles must be fixed to wliat they are intended to move, or they cannot acton it; and they must be fixed at some other point also, or they would waste their power on nothing, instead of impartingmotion. And, of course, the stronger they are, the stronger must what they are fixed to be, and the larger also to admit of more and more strength. Well, the muscles that move the bird's wing are affixed at their other extremities to its breastbone and men-y-thought, and hence the size and strength of these bones in the Falcon kind with their vigorous, impetuous l%ht and sweep of wing; and the o iiUj-aruuve insigiiiricance and MEANS OF FLlbilT IN THE OWLS. 4.\\\\ wcakrioss of Uie same parts in the slow-flying, noiseless-winged Owlet. If our young friends are disposed (o udJ, in their collection of birds' eggs, ti^e so-called merry-l liought of each sepai'ate bird to the eggs laid by that bird, they will be apt to learn an interesting and instructive lesson in elementary anatomy. And such a collection may be made to a great exteu!,, without much trouble, by almost every one who has the ordinary facLHties of a residence in the country at his command. Having said so much to show how even the most simple and obvious and familiar dilTerences in the bone structure of birds suggests, or, if not, confirms the principle of classification of bii'ds, and therefore of their eggs, let us now go on to notice our quaint \\\"feathered friends,\\\" the Owls, and especially our more famihar acquaintance among them. There are other things belonging to the Owl family, which our sharp young friend just named would have just as little trouble in picking out from a heap of similar objects, as in the case of the bones. I mean the eggs. The same character, however much they vary in size \\u2014 and they do vary vastly in size \\u2014 is common to every one of the eggs. They are all white ; they are all very slightly oval, or very nearly round, and you cannot tell wh'ch is meant to be the big end, and which the little. Of course, this being the case, it would be of very little use to take up the small space available for illustration in this book, with representations of Owls' eggs ; and for the same reason, as little as possible will be said in the way of description. Any Owl's eggs which are likely to come under the notice of the school-boy nest-hunter wUl tell himagooddeal about their origin, bj their size and the place they are found in ; and the best picture ana description possible would not be able to teach him half as much. Just as the bones, noticed a page or two back, would be found to show that there was a sort of approach to something like a \\u00abS BRITISH BIRDS, THEIK EGGS AND NE5>TS. noticeable connection between the Harriers and the Owls, so the eggs of the former seem to hint at something of the same \\u00a3ind. The merry-thought and breast-bone of the Harriers are yastlj less strong and solid than those of the true Falcons ; and, so to speak, intermediate in such respects between these and those of tlie truest Owl, while the eggs are colourless or nearlj so, and so approach again to the Owl type. 24. EAGLE OWL\\u2014 {Bubo maximus.) This noble bird, the first on our list of British Owls, is sa occasionally and irregularly seen in Britain, that it can scarcely claim lengthened notice at our hands. 25. SCOPS EARED OWL.\\u2014 {Scops Aldrovattdi). Almost, or rather certainly, more rare than the preceding. 26. LONG-EARED OWL.\\u2014 {Otus vulgaris). Met with, though not very abundantly, in most parts of England. Its haunt during the day time is in ivy bushes, or other retreats affording security from the access of much light, its nest is most frequently an appropriated old nest of the Crow or Magpie ; perhaps even what was once the breeding-home of the Squirrel; and m it are laid four or five eggs IW inch long, by ] 2 ? iiich broad. It seeks its prey after sunset ; and as birds of various kinds are known to form part of its food, it seems almost certain that they must be taken as they sit at roost. What sad bug-a-boos Horned Owls must be made to offending j uveniles in little-bird nurseries. 27. SHORT-EARED OWL\\u2014 (Oto brachyotus). Woodcock Owl, Short-horned Howlet, Mousehawk, Hawk Owl. It breeds with us, but not very commonly, and many seem to come over in the autumn, and they are then frequently Been is a stubble, or otherwise roused by the sportsman. It*. BASN OWL, 43 nest is sometimes on the ground, and perhaps even in a rabbitburrow. The eggs are thi-ee in number, and scarcely differ the least in size from those of the bii-d last named. Young Grouse and other birds breeding about the moors are abundantly supplied by the parent Owls to their young when the nest chances to have been made in such a locality, and the old ones are very jealous of seeing their progeny too nearly approached, and expose themselves almost as fearlesaly on such occasions as either Partridge or Grouse. Tiieir local name of Ilawk-Owl is derived from the circumstance that they pursue their prey \\u2014 regularly \\\"hawking\\\" for it \\u2014 daring the daytime. 2S. EARN 0\\\\N'L\\u2014{Slj-lxJlammed). White Owl, Yellow Owl, Screech Owl, Gilly Howlet, Howlet, Madge Howlet, Church Owl, Hissing Owl. \\u2014 This common and useful bird breeds by preference in some building or part of one . a church tower, dove-cot, ruined mansion, or castle, and the Hke. My most familiar boy-acquaintance, however, was with the nesting place and habits of a pair which nested for many consecutive years in a slight hollow in the crown of a large pollard Elm tree in my father's church-yard in Essex. Thero were usually three or four young ones year by year, often with perceptible differences of growth among tliem. Indeed it is well kno\\\\Tn that this Owl and the last named, and probably others as well, lay their eggs in instalments, as it were, and when the first batch of two is about hatching or nearly so, other two are deposited in addition, and thus hatched in their turn almost as much by their brother and sister as by thfiir mother. Quainter, graver, odder, stranger, more irresistibly comic creatm-es than these young Owls I never saw; and the hissing and snormg, and peering looks at the spectator, and strange \\\"ntic contortions I heard and saw, bafHe all attempts 44 BRITISH BIKDS, THEIR \\u00a3GCiS AND iitSTS, at description. The eutcrtainment, for such it was most truly, usually begaa some little time before sunset, about which time the old bii'ds might be seen commencing thoir hibours of purveying food for Masters and Misses Howlet. At intervals of from seven to ten minutes one or other of them came to the nest with a prey, and I could always tell by the sounds and gestures of the young Owls when the old one was approaching. How they knew I could not tell ; it was not by sight, and I could hear no sound myself; but know they did most certainly. Mice, slugs, sometimes a large insect apparently, or a small bird, very rarely a Mole, or Eat of no large dimensions, were brought in continuous succession, and in the claw, not with the bUl. When the animal was of small dimensions, the old Owl flitted off again ivith scarcely any pause at the nest. It a large one, it seemed by the time which elapsed, and the sounds which became audible \\u2014 most vehement suorings and hissings \\u2014 that partition had to be made, and that the said partition was a matter ol the greatest interest to the parties concerned. I cannot affirm positively that the old Owls prosecuted then- most successful hunting all through the night ; but T believe they did, and I have seen them still at work in the morning long after sun-rise, once as lale as between eight and nine in the morning in the height of summer. As the inmates of a dove-cot, they are on very excellent terms with the proper dwellers therein, although from the known habits of other Owls the human ownens oi the dove-cot are apt to assume, most groundlessly and unjustly, th\\u00bb,t they are sure to destroy the yoimg Pigeons. I don't believe, however, that if all the rejected pellets of bones, fur, feathers, fee, from all the Barn Owls in the kingdom could be examined, tliat any trace of pigeon, old or young, would be discovered ; and that fanner is a foolish farmer who either destroys m Bam TAWNY QWL. 4s Owl himself or suffers any one else, whom he coT;ld prevent, to destroy one. They are perfectly harmless, exceedingly useful, and strangely interesting to the observer. I may add that since I began to write these lines, I am told that the self-same tree is still occupied by a pair of the self-same Owls, and has continued to be from the days of my boyish recollections \\u2014 a period of more than thirty yeais. The young of this and the next species are very bold, resolute little creatures, if taken when rather more than half-grown. They wiU throw themselves on their backs, and defend themselves pertinaciously with bill and claw against any foe, or supposed foe, human or other. The Barn Owl lias been known to take fish by plunging upon it in the water. The eggs are about li inch long, by 1| broad. 29. TAWNY 0'V^'L\\u2014{Si/rnium stridula). Brown Owl, Wood Owl, Hoot Owl, Ivy Owl, Jenny Howlet. This is the bird whose well-known and, as I think, musical note is so often heard at night in wooded countries, in the genuine \\\"tu-whit-to-who-o-o-o,\\\" or \\\"hoot.\\\" The last-named, or Barn Owl, is the Screech Owl proper, though not, in my experience, very much addicted to indulge in her unpleasant song. I very seldom used to hear a downright good screech in those old days. The Brown Owl makes its nest \\u2014 at least, lays its eggs \\u2014 in some lioUow tree, usually in a wood or near one. Some times a few feathers or a little moss may receive the eg^?,, often only the decayed wood. I have heard of the nest of this bird in other positions ; e.ff., in a deserted Crow's nest, or a hole in a rocky bank. But the hollow tree is the rule. The eggs are three or four in number, and larger than the Barn Owl's, being about lj\\u00a7 inch long, by 1| inch broad. The old birds nave two or three notes besides the hoot; one being a short, rather Bnarp cluck, often repeated. The young ones, after they fly 46 BRITISH BIRDS, THEIR EGGS AND NESTS. depend a good deal on their parents' exertions for food, which consists of young Rabbits, Hares, now and then birds of sorts. Rats, Mice, &c. I once saw a young Brown Owl, apparently waiting for its food to be brought, and sitting very still on the topmost bough of a tall tree, aimost knocked off his perch by the whizzing flight of a Wild Duck. The Owl ducked liis head, or I thought the Duck would have actually struck him, so near was the encounter. 30. SNOWY OWL\\u2014iSurnianyctea). A beautiful bird, of very rare occurrence. 31. HAWK OWL\\u2014{Surmaftinerea). Canada Owl \\u2014 ]\\\\Iore rare than the last. 32. LITTLE OVJlj\\u2014{Noctt(a passerind). Little Night Owl, Sparrow Owl \\u2014 A very occasional visitant. 33.

GEJEAT GKEY SHRIKE\\u2014 (Z\\u00ab\\u00ab?\\u00abs excubitor). Greater Butchel Bird, Ash-coloured Shrike, Cinereous Shrike. Grey Shrike \\u2014 This bird is an occasional visitor only, and has very rareiy been seen in the breeding season. No authentic instance of its nesting with us is known. 35. RED-BACKED SHRIKE\\u2014 (Z\\u00ab\\u00abj\\u00ab\\u00ab eoUurtd). Lesser Butcher Bird, Elusher, Murdering-pie, Jack Baker, SPOTTED FLY-CATCHER. 47 &c. \\u2014 nie male of this species is a beautiful bird, with his bright cnesnut back and lively air. They spend only a part of the year with us, but that part involves the period of nesting. The nest is usually rather high up in a strong, thick bush, large-sized for the bird, cup-shaped, and made of coarse withered herbage externally, with rather finer materials within, and lined with hair or some such substance. The eggs are four or five in number, varying much in colour and marks. The ground-shade varies, and so do the markings ; the latter, however, being usually found thicker and darker in a zone or band encircling some part of the egg. Description is quite inadequate to convey any idea of these variations. The bird deserves its name, for it \\\" slaughters \\\" small birds, as well as other animals, and hangs up the carcases in regular shambles. It is wonderful how the frogs, beetles, caterpillars, cock-chafers, bii'ds, &c., which form its food, are fixed so very firmly and tenaciously upon the strong thorny point. \\u2014 Fiffs. 4, 5, plate II. 36. WOODCHAT SHRIKE\\u2014 (Z:\\u00ab\\u00abt\\u00abs ru/us). Only an occasional visitant. II.\\u2014 MUSCICAPID^. 37. SPOTTED 'E'LYGA.TCTn^R\\u2014iMusctcapa^risola). Beam-bird, Bee-bird, Rafter -bu'd. Post-bird, Wall-bird, Cherry. chopper. Cherry-sucker, Cobweb-bu'd. Many of these names are taken from the familiar site of its nest, or from some of its habitti in taking food. It will return to the same post, after a short eicursion to seize an insect, ten or a dozen times m succession ; und it wUl build its nest on a wall, on the end of a rafter or beam, on a rake-head, in a trained wall-tree \\u2014 in fact, in almost every conceivAble place. The nest varies in material and struo 48 BRITISH BIRDS, THErR EGGS AND NESTS ture, almost as much as in its site. Moss, old and new, bents, straws, twigs, hairs, feathers, all are used. It is an amusing little bird, and pays many feeding visits to its young, as is the case with all insect-feeding birds. The eggs are four or Cwe in number, of dull white, tinged with blue, and spotted with faint red. It only visits us to breed here. \\u2014 Fi^. G, picde IT. 38. m:D JLYCATCBER\\u2014iiVuscicapa atricapilla.) Goldfinch. \\u2014 A rare bird in some localities, and not an abundant one in any. The nest is loosely made of small roots, bents, grass, moss, hair, or some such material, iu a hole, usually in pollard trees, or such as have decayed from natural causes, but sometimes also in a hole in a wall or other building. In it may \\\\if^ found four to eight eggs of a uniform light blue coloui-. \\u2014 Fig. 7, jjiate IT. III.\\u2014 MEEULIDJE. 39. COMMON DIPPER\\u2014 (a\\u00abefe\\u00ab aquaticus.) Water-ouzel, Brook-ouzel, Water-crow, Water-piet, Bessyducker. \\u2014 I may as well own that I am a little bit \\\" fond \\\" about the Dipper. I dearly love to see him and hear liim in my rambles by our mountain becks. So lively, cheery, and jolly, even In the cold winter day, when the mere look of the chilly, shivering stream makes one feel goosc-skirmy. There he sits at the water edge, and sings like a Robin a little tipsy, and then in he tumbles, in a rollicking sort of way, as you become a little too niquisitive, and emerging a few yards further down, takes wing, and darts off v ith his Kingfisher-like flight. One nest some lads belonging to my family found here, was a feather-bed sort of structure of moss and a few feathers, filling up a six-inch square hole in the masom^y of a bridge in wliich one of the scaffold- MISSEL THRUSH. 49 rafters of the workmen had been inserted, there being a small, rouna nole left in the exposed side for exit and ingress. Others may be seen in cavities in a rock by the water-side ; and one 1 heard of, if my memory is correet, in Berwickshire, was built amid the stone-work of a water-lead for conducting the waste water away from a mill, and in sucii a position that the water in :ts fall projected itself beyond the nest, and formed a kind of arch above it. The old birds in going into or leaving their nest had actually to pass in either from the side or through the interstices of the small cascade. The eggs are five or six in number, and perfectly, purely white. A sad enemy to fish spawn 1 fear my little while-breasted friend is. I never yet carea to shoot one, I love them so well. But when there are half-a-dozen small but very hungry Dipper-mouths to be fed, I fear much consumption of fishes' food, as well as fishes' eggs, takes place. It is able to walk, though with much effort, under water, as weU as dive and swim ; and I have often seen them, on coming to the surface in a quiet pool, remain perfectly quiescent and floating for several seconds, \\u2014 Fig. S, j^late II. 40. MISSEL THUUSH\\u2014 (r\\u00ab/-t/\\u00abs viscivorus). Misseltoe Thrush, Missel-bird, Stormcock, Screech Thrush, Holm Thrush, Holm Screech. \\u2014 A handsome bu-d and an early builder. The Missel Thrash seems to lay aside some of its wildness in the breeding season, and draws near the dwellings of men. Its nest may continually be found in a garden or orchard close to a house, and in the thick fork of an apple or other fruit tree, often only a few feet from the ground. Woe be to the Cat who comes near the nest ! Such a storm of violent abuse and loud-tongued birds' Billingsgate as is poured on her devoted head ! Nor does the human intruder escape quite without a telling of it, or what my 60 BRITISH BIRDS, THEIR EGGS AND N\\u00a3ST\\u00bb. Yorksliire friends term \\\" a calling.\\\" If a Missel Thrush is very angry with you, be sure his nest is not far off. It is a larsjo structure, of much such materials and design as the Blackbird's, but often bound round and round with long rushes or roots, or other material sufficiently lengthy and pliable. The eggs, tour or five in general, often vary much in colouring and marks ; but are in general of a whitish ground-colour, lightly tinged with green (or perhaps faint red), and well spotted with red-brown. \\u2014 Fig. 9, Tplate II. 41. WHITE'S THRUSH\\u2014 (y\\u00abr^\\u00ab* Wbitei). Only a very rare visitant. 42. FIELDFARE\\u2014 (r\\u00ab?-</z\\u00ab pilaris). Felfit, Felty-fare, Blue-back, Jack-bird. \\u2014 A very common winter visitor, and staying sometimes as late as 10th May. But they do not breed with us ; and as space is not too abundant, any notice which can be afforded of this bu-d's nesting habits must be put in the Appendix, if found possible. 43. COMMON THRUSH\\u2014 (r\\u00abriKS musicus). Song Thrush, Throstle, Mavis. \\u2014 Every one knows this sweet songster, and could point out its pet stone v/ith its little accumulation of shattered snail shells, which, when whole, had been brought there by the knowmg Thrush and hammered agamst the well-fixed anvil until they gave way. Every body knows his persevering song, begun at day-dawn in early February, and persevered in for months of the spring and early summer. Every one knows its trim, neatly-plastered nest, with its warm, solid coating of grass and bents and roots and such like materials. And every body too, knows the four or five fair blue eggs with iheir tidy black spots, which now and then, however, can hardly be seen at all. Every body also knows how fussy the old mother BLACRBILD. 51 Thrush is the day her brood quit their nest ; and how, if you catch one of her luvkward, ill-ilying, soon-tired squad of young ones, she will follow you with much objurgation and no little plaintive entreaty that \\\"a great fellow like you, who ought to be ashamed of yourself for frightening a poor little fluttering creatur-e like that, will put it down again soon, and not hurt it, and be a dear, good man, \\u2014 now do, won't you ! \\\" \\u2014 Fig. 10, plate II. * 42.

Merle in Shakspeare. \\u2014 The Blackbird's tawny bill and sable plumage aud sweet meUow song \\u2014 would one like it as well if he were as lavish of it as the Thrush ? \\\"Who does not welcome and love him ? A:id to a very youthful nest-hunter what a deserving bird the Blackbird is. Making his nest usually in such places and so that detection is not at all a matter of course, and yet not altogether beyond the discenmient of inexperienced eyes. The discovery of our first Blackbkd's nest is always felt to be a sort of achievement, aud one to be spoken of with ixasonable seK- approbation too. Li the hedge, at the bottom of the hedge, on the stump, behind the stump, below the stump, an exciesence on the side of the ragged old tree, in a wall tree, in an evergreen or other thick bush \\u2014 how often have we found the nest ic these and such like places. Once we found one which we sel donm as made by the untidiest Blackbird that ever lived. It was Li a thorn hedge thick and high, and a great rough structure. But a lock of wool, a big one, had been unmanageable and had E 2 53 BKlTISll BIRDS, TUEIR EGGS AND NEStfl. caught on the thonis, and the feathered architect couIJ do nothing with it, and there it hung out of the ncst-wali a thick tangle, inches long, and making the nest as conspicuous as it a flag had been stuck just above it.

A bold abusive freebooter in our gardens in North Yorkshire, and other similar localities. lie's a beautiful bird, and a wary, except when seduced by strawberries and red currants. His wild and not unmusical note, though it might sound harsh in a trim garden in Kent or Essex, and to an ear not attuned to moorland sounds, is always as welcome to me as the gentler twitter of the Swallow. I like to hear his attempts at song, reminding the listener of the Missel-bird's early spring music. kxA I like to hear his wilder, grating call-note, which is the usual warning the ornithologist has that the Moor Blackbird has returned for the season. His nest is very like the Blackbird's in design and general structure. An inner lining of bents and fine ling, a wall of clay, and an outer husk of moss, ling, and such like moorland matters. It is not strongly or compactly formed, and makes a great litter if kept a day or two and subject to be handled or moved, however carefully. It is always built on, or near the ground, on the wild moor ; and I once trod the feathers out of the wing of a sitting hen, oa whom and her nest 1 nearly trod in leaping a guUy. The eggs are usually four or five in number, and remind you of the Blackbird's eggs in I heir general appearance; but the blotchings or markings are redder, and often much larger or more pronounced than in the K(;IUN. 53 case of llie Blackbird. Their eggs, too, vary generally in size, even in the same nest. Out of the contents of two nests I had brought to me a year or two since, no two seemed to agree exactly in dimensions. \\u2014 Fig. 12, flute II, 45.

It was Hedge-Sparrow in my childhood and youth, and Hedgesparrow to me it will be called to the end of the chapter. I coidd no more wantonly kill a Iledge-Sparrow, in my sparrowkilling days, than a Robin ; and now, wlien I liear his low, sweet pipe, and see his wings quivered as he hops on the ground or from spray to spray not knowing I am noticing him, he seems as dear to me as ever. The mossy nest, with its intermixture of fino roots and hairs, may be found weeks before leaves are thought of, on the bank-side or low in the hedge, and little concealed ; and the four or five \\\"beautiful blue eggs in it become familiar to every nest-seeker among his very earliest acquisitions. \\u2014 Fig. 13,plaie!T, 48.

It seems to be, or to liave been, a common reeling among boys, and is embodied in the old lines : \\u2014 \\\" The Robin and the Wren Are God's Cock and Hen.\\\" ITow beautiful the Robin's eggs are when just laid ; and how they lose their peculiar pinky loveliness from being blown. A hundred different places, too, the little bird selects for the site of its nest ; often being such, moreover, as to illustrate their confiding fearlessness, as much as the result in them of the pressure of winter cold and hunger. In the tilt ot a wagon ; in a steam-boat ; in a room of the cottage ; near a blacksmith's forge ; in the constantlyused garden-shed, as well as in the ivy or evergreen bush ; or on the bank, or in the hedge ; or in a hole in the old ruin or bank or house-wall : all places seem to suit it alike. The eggs are five or six, sometimes seven; and the shell is wliite, more or less freckled with light red. \\u2014 Fig, 14, plate II. 49. BLUE-THROATED WARBLER\\u2014 (P//^\\u00ab/cKm Suecica).

Eiretail, Fireflirt, BrantaU, Redtail. \\u2014 The male is one of the most beautiful of cm- small birds, and I wish I could think it as abundant with us as it used to be. The nest is loosely constructed of moss, with a few small straws or bents sometimes, and hair and feathers inside, and almost invariably is placed iu a hole, it may be in a hollowish tree, or a wall, or even in a bank ; and here, where dry-stone walls abound, its choice of nestingplaces is inexhaustible. Very watchful are the old birds over the eggs, and very fussy and noisy when the eggs have yielded their living contents, and yet very careful too. I knew there was a nest the vear before last not far from my garden gate ; but it was WUIN-CUAT. 55 not till I hid myself most carefully and patiently beliind the door, that I made myself master of the vigilant little sentinel's secret. It lays four or five, and, occasionally, six eggs, of a pale uniform blue colour, perhaps tinged with a faint green shade. They ire almost as pretty as the Hedge-Sparrow's. \\u2014 Fig. 15, plate II. 51. BLACK REDSTART\\u2014 (P/5^\\u00ab?VKra Tithys).

Sione-cliatter, Stone-clink, Stone-smick, Stone-chack, Stonesmith, Moor-titling, Chick stone, Black-cap. \\u2014 A very rommon bb:d m many districts, and from his habits much more familiarly and commonly known and noticed than other birds equally or even more abundant, but of less obtrusive, or quieter habits. Flitting about from bush to bush, and seating himselfpertly on the top spray, there he sits and \\\" cliats \\\" or \\\" clinks \\\" till the passenger comes too near, and then off he flies again, to perch again a few yards fiu'ther and repeat the same performance. The nest, sometimes very neat and well-constructed, of moss and benty grass, and lined with hair, feathers, fine grass-stalks, &c., is often quite on the groimd and with no bush near ; sometimes at the foot of a low bush, or in the bush itself, but very near the ground. The eggs are five or six, of a pale blue ground, very sparingly freckled with dull reddish brown, and chiefly near the large end. The nest is often hard to find, and especiaDy when built among longish herbage, or in or near a whin-bush. \\u2014 Fig. 16, plate II. 53. WHIN-CHAT.\\u2014 (^^orjVo^a ruhctra). Grass-cnat, Eurze-chat. \\u2014 Many of the bnds last-named pass the whiter in England ; but only a few of the Whin-chats. This is never so abundant a species as the last, and though with some 50 BRITISH BIRDS, TIIKIR EGGS AND N' tSTs, Bimilar habits it has no urgent inclination to force us to notice it by the incessant repetition of its note. The nest strongly resembles that of the Stone-chat. It is also usually placed on the ground, and is folly as hard to find as that bird's. The eggs, five or six of them, are of a uniform blueish green, very slightly speckled or marked with dull-red. \\u2014 Fig, 17, plate II. 54. WHEAT-EAR\\u2014 (5'\\u00ab.nco/a cenanthe). Eallow-chat, \\\"VVhite-rump, \\\"V\\\\Tiite-tail, Eallow-smick, Fallowfinch, Chacker, Chackbird, Clodhopper, with some other quainter names still, which I have noted down, and yet another or two common to the Wlieat-ear and Stone-chat, such as Stone-ohacker. A common bird enough liere, and with some of the more obvious habits of the Stone-chat. It perches on the stone walls as one approaches it, and flirts its tail and chacks, and then diving below the wall on the far side, re-appears again ten or twelve yards lower, and acts as before ; and so on for a hundred yards or more. The stone walls in our district and the large heaps of stones, removed in reclaiming parts of the moor and flung promiscuously together any where to be out of tlie way, afford them capital breeding places. In other countries old walls, or holes in the sides of pits or excavations, serve their purpose. The nest is not very artistic or well-finished, and formed of many different materials \\u2014 bents, feathers, dry roots, fur, in short any waste matters which may have come in the way of the builders. The Eggs are five or six in number, and of a pale-blue colour not so dark as tliose of the Hedge-Sparrow. It is said that ])eople accustomed to the habits of the Wheat-eai- are al)lc to find its nest without dilBcidty, from the occurrence r.f certain noticeable sicrr-s ii: its neighbourhood. \\u2014 Vlrj. ], jilale III. REED WAKULKK. 57 55. GllASSHOPPER WARBLER\\u2014 (Salicana locusteUa). A summer visitor, of shy and retired habits, and very vigilant. Its note, very shrill and constantly repeated, reminding one of tlie Crieket or Grassliopper's note, gains it its name. The nest is liard to find, and unless the bird be very closely watched, it may baffle a good observer. It is placed in spots matted and overhung with growtli of grass or other herbage and bushes ; is cup-shaped, made of coarse dry grass, wiLli finer within ; and contains sometimes as many as seven eggs, of a pale pinky-white colour, freckled witli spots of a darker shade of red.\\u2014 ^;V7. 2, plate III. 56. SEDGE WAllBLEIl-(&/j6-\\u00aby7\\u00ab phragmilis). Tin's everlasting little songster is more conniion tiian the bird last named, and almost every boy knows its peculiar chiding note. Many a lad, too, knows that by shying a stone in near its haunt, its notes may be elicited almost any hour in the night or day. I think I have neard it singing on all through the night, and notwithstanding the absence of any pretence at dayUght. Its nest is usually placed near the ground, in the vicinity of more or less water, and is supported, as well as concealed, by the coarse lierbage. Made of coarse grass stalks externally, and lined witli finer ones and hair, sometimes with a foundation of moss, five or SIX eggs are deposited in its cup-shaped lioUow, of a pale brown colour, a little mottled witli darker brown. \\u2014 Fig. 3, plate III. 57.

Almost as zealous a songster as the Sedge Warbler. There are few hours in the twenty-four 55 BKITISII BIRDS, THEIR EGGS AND NESTS. when its voice may not be heard about its accustomed haunts ; namely, willow and reed beds, and particularly the latter. The nest is, perhaps, the deepest made by any English bu-d,'and quite a long inverted none in shape. It is affixed lo, or rathei built so as to include turee or four reeds, or more. So that, however the wind blows, it is quite fast, wliile its great depth prevents the eggs falling out, even if the reeds be blown almost level. The bird has been seen still sitting when the violent gusts forced the nest down almost to the water level. The nest is made of long grass and the seed-stalks of the reed, and lined with wool or the like. Four or five eggs of a greenish-wliite Dolour, marked in spots and dashes of green and pale brown, are usually laid. \\u2014 yirj. 4, plate III. 59. NIGHTINGALE.\\u2014 (P/ii7oOTe/a iKscitiia). This sweetest of the English warblers has but a limited range [n Essex, Suffolk and Cambridgeshire, I used to hear it abundantly ; but of late years, as a resident in Yorkshire, its note iias become strange in my cars. Shy and vigilant in its habits, it does not willingly expose itself to observation, and its haunts are so thick that discovery of its nest is not always easy. It seems often an untidy structui'c, but according to my observation, not usually built on the ground, as Mr. Yarrcll states. I have found it in a thick thorn hedge or bush, and in slu'ubs in the tjarden; made of twigs, straw, grass, and especially old oak leaves, and with only a jagged margm. The eggs, four aud sometimes five of them, are of \\\" an uniform olive-brown colour,\\\" and from the time they are laid, the bird only sings occasionalij. Alter they are hatched, never. \\u2014 Fi^. 5, plaie III. GO. BLACKCAP. \\u2014 {Curruca atricapilla). Blackcap ^Vai-bler. \\u2014 This bird, with several others, has a local GARDKN WAKBLER. 59 or country hame in common, derivable, I believe, from the structure of the nest. I mean Hay-jack or Ilay-chat; but it is I think, much less frequently distinguished by that name than the three birds next to be mentioned. The country-boy's name for one of these must always be distrusted, as is the case also with Ids designation of other common, but much more dissimilar birds. Thus, not to mention other instances, the Blackcap proper, the Greater Tom-tit and the Stone-chat are all called Blackcap. \\u2014 The Blackcap Warbler comes to us in spring and builds in our gardens and shrubberies as frequently as ia wilder resorts, but always in places where there is thick foliage and plentiful means of concealment. It is a very shy bird and very unwilling to be gazed at. If it sees you watching it, you soon lose sight of it as it hops and twists from spray to spray into the inner and shadiest recesses of its haunt. Its nest, too, is studiously concealed, and Mr. Yarrell says it will leave two or three just-commenced nests in succession, on light grounds of suspicion that it has been noticed in its labours. The nest is a benty, and saving for the ties of wool or cobweb, a slightly compacted edifice, lined with hair and fine fibres, and contains four or five eggs of varying colour and mottlings \\u2014 white, greenish or tinged with a peculiar shade of faint red, being the groundcoloui-, with markings of a reddish brown. \\u2014 Fig. 0, plale III. Gl. GA.IIDEN WARBLER\\u2014 ((7\\u00ab;T\\u00abm hortemis). Pettychaps, Greater Pettychaps. \\u2014 Inferior to the Blackcap in song, as the Blackcap is inferior to the Nightingale, only not at so great a distance. Still it is a sweet songster. It comes to us to breed, and frequents thick hedges and the covert afforded by our shrubberies and pleasure-plantings in gardens. The nest, like the Blax;k''ap*s in materials and detail, of dry grass-stalks or 61) BRITISH BIRDS, THEIR KliGS A.SU m'sIS bents loosely twined but bound together with wool, &c., and Jined with hair and fibrous roots, may bo found among rank growth of various herbage, or in a bush, or iu a row of rodded peas. The usual four or five eggs are of muddled-white, stained and Epotted with greenish brown, lighter or darker. \\u2014 Fig. \\\", plate III. 62. WHITE-THROAT\\u2014 (C\\u00abrrac\\u00ab cinerca). Nettle-crcepcr. \\u2014 Another pleasant singer, but with occasional harsher notes, and a chiding one, not unlike the Sedgebird's, when uneasy or irritated. This is the usual Haychat of the country lads, and fully as often called the Nettle-creeper; the former name being due to the fabric of its nest, the latter to its habits of twining in and out of the leaves and coarse herbage which abound among its haunts. Little description of the nest is needed, except that it seems slighter, and is thinner at the sides than those last named, but still it is not less compact. The eggs vary a good deal in appearance, but there is still such a family likeness among them that they are easily recognizable by most eggfanciers. Green, in different shades, is the predominating colour. \\u2014Fij. 8, plate III. C3. LESSER MllYYE-1BR0kT\\u2014{Cunuca syhiella). Not so common a bird nearly, as the last, and rising higher in the bushes and shrubberies it frequents than it. It shigs low and pleasantly when you arc near enough to hear it, and very incessantly, but its more frequently heard notes are ratlier harsh. The nest, found among low bushes and brambles, is like the Whitethroat's, and the fcur or five eggs laid in it are white, speckled, most at the large end, with ash or light brown. \\u2014 Fig. 9, plate III. 64. WOOD WARBLER\\u2014 (^y/i7\\u00ab\\u00ab sibilatrix). Wood Wren, Yellow TVren. \\u2014 This bird was long confounded with the Willow AVrcn to be named next. It comes to us for CniFFCHAFF. 61 the summer, the males (as is the case with so many of tha Warblers), coming first by several days. It is abundant enough in some well-wooded parts of the kingdom, and its song is only called such by courtesy. It builds a domed nest ; that is one covered in above, and with a side entrance ; on the ground amid grass or weeds. It is made of grass, dead leaves, moss, and lined with hair and soft grass. The eggs are six in number, wiiite, and very much speckled and spotted with dark redpurple. \\u2014 Fig. 10, plate III. G5. WILLOW WREN\\u2014 (^^/f/\\u00ab trocldlus). WUiow Warbler, Yellow Wren, Scotch Wren, Hay-bird, Iluckrauck, Ground Wren. \\u2014 A well known little bird to the observant. It sings \\\" a soft and pleasuig \\\" song, and is a lively little fellow, in incessant motion. Very restless and uneasy too, when you are near its nest, and particularly if the young are hatched. The nest is domed, externally like the one last named, but always lined with feathers, wliich the last never is. It is built on a bank or bankside, among grass or other herbage, and contains five to seven eggs, white, with many small speckles of red not very dark. There is an instance on record, in which this bird did not leave its nest tliough it had been bodily removed from its site on the ground, and even before any eggs were laid or the nest itself completed \\u2014 one of the most remarkable cases of the kmd known. \\u2014 Fig. 11, plate III. 66. CHirrCHAPE\\u2014 (5y/wa hippolais). Lesser Pettychaps, Least Willow Wren. \\u2014 An \\\"early bird\\\" this is in coming to us in spring time, and able and willing enough to take its substitute for the \\\" worm.\\\" The two syllables of its name, differently accented, form its song. Its nest is like that of the ^Villow Wren, with the addition of a few dead leaves outside 62 BRITISH BIRDS, TIIEIK EGGS AND NESTS. and abundance of featliers inside, and is also placed on (or very near) the ground on a hedgebank. Tlie CbiiTcliaff lays six eggs, white, with specks of dark purplish-red. \\u2014 Fig. 12, plate III. 67. DARTFORD ^K^^ljY^^\\u2014iMelizophilusprovindaUs). A bird wliich is scarcely known except on some of the furze, growing commons of the South, especially Kent and Surrey The nest is of dry grass-stalks, loosely put together and tied with wool, and sparingly lined with other fine and dry vegetable substances. \\\" The eggs,\\\" we read in Yarrell, \\\" are somewhat similar to those of the Wliitetliroat, but rather less ; and Hke tliem, are tinged with green. They are speckled all over with olive-brown and cinereous on a greenish white groiond; the markings becoming more dense and forming a zone at the large end.\\\"\\u2014 J?y. 13, plate TIL 68. GOLD-CRESTED REGULUS\\u2014 (i?^^\\u00ab&5 crhtatm). Gold-crest, Gold-crested Wren, Golden-crested Warbler, Goldcrowned Kinglet. \\u2014 One of the smallest of our native birds and possessing a \\\" soft and pleasing song.\\\" Its nest \\u2014 one of the very most beautiful of all our English nests \\u2014 is built below the branch of a spruce fir-tree and near the end of the bough, being suspended to two or more of the spreading side-boughs. These are often woven in with the moss and wool of the nest, and then tliere is a Uuing of feathers; spiders' webs too are used to compact the structure. Seven or eight eggs are laid, which vary remarkably, in d. ffcrent nests, in both ground-shade and markings. Some remind one of the usual Robin's egg in both, though the spots are much finer. Others are pale white, with yellowishbrown (rather than red) speckles, \\u2014 Fig. 14, plate III. BLUE TITMOUSR. 63 69. FIRE-CRESTED 'KEGULUS\\u2014CRec/ulus iffmcapiUus). Much less common than the last, though very likely often confounded with it from its great general resemblance. Its nest is like its gold-crowned relation's, and the eggs seem to resemble the variety first described in the above notice of that bird. V. PARID^. 70. GREAT TITMOUSE.\\u2014 rPara* major). Great Tit, Oxeye, Blackcap, Great Blackheaded Tomtit, Pickcheese. \\u2014 It might also be called, and I believe is in one district, ths Saw-sharpener, for its note certainly puts one in mind of tha\\u00bb; agreeable musical operation. The Tomtits are familiar to all of us, and \\\"impudent\\\" is one of the epithets we most usually apply to the whole tribe. Most of them breed in some hollow place or hole. The nest of the Great Tit is formed of moss, with a feather lining, and is sometimes placed in a hole in a wall ; sometimes in some appropriate recess in a hollow tree. Like the other Tits, it lays many eggs, occasionally from six to nine. They are white, of fair size, and well spotted as well as speckled with a decided shade of red. There is an easHy recognised resemblance between the eggs of all the Tomtit family. \\u2014 Fig. 15, plate III. 71. BLUE TITMOUSE\\u2014 (^Par?;5 caruleus). Tomtit, Blue Tomtit, Nun, Blue-cap, Blue-bonnet, BiUy-biter, Hickwall, Blue Mope. \\u2014 One of the most impudent of an impudent lot. A pair had biult their nest in a crevice between the lintel and stonework of my coacli-house, and my children from their nursery window observed it. Eor their amusement I got a ladder and looked in. The bold little matron could not be induced to leave the hole, but spit and hissed like a regulai 64 BRITISH niivus, their eggs and nests. vixen, and tried to make herself as big -as two by ruflling up het featlicrs, so as to friglitcn the owners of tlic ugly faces, as she would tliiuk, she saw at her door. Often, too, have I been bitten sharply by one I had laid hold of. Almost any hole in any object will do for the nest-site. Even a bottle, a wooden box, a pump-barrel, a quccr-sliaped cavity in an old tree only big enough to admit such a small creature, all are made available. The nest is voluminous, of moss, hair, and feathers ; and the eggs are abnosl endless. From six up to twelve or thirteen is of common occur rence. Llr. Ilewitson mentions one case of eighteen eggs 1 They are white, and spotted with pale red. The jouiTicys of the old birds to and from the nest when supplying their large family with food are literally innumerable ; and the number of small catcr])Lllars, grubs, plant-lice, and the like, destroyed by these jidefatigable caterers, must be simply astonishing. I think the pair just now referred to made at least one visit to the nest every two minutes throughout the day. The climbing, clinging habits of this and other Tomtits are very amusing; and in former days I made them dance on the slack-rope for my amusement and my friends'. 1 strung a nut or two on a piece of strong thread, and tied the two extremities to a tree and a nail in a wall near the window, respectively. This plan gave me many lengthened opportunities for watching their ways. I have also seen them stripping off the loose bark from pine-planks and picking out the fine fat grubs which eat their way between the wood and the bark. \\u2014 Eig. IG, flate III. 72.

Incessantly active and frequently associating with other small bii'ds it prosecutes a restless search for the small insects and seeds which form its food. Ita nest, of moss and wool and hair, is placed in a hole in a tree, sometimes very near the ground ; sometimes even in a hole in the ground which has been made by some small quadi-uped. Like the other Tits, if necessary it wiU enlarge a hole in. a tree which it finds already such as nearly to suit its requirements. Sis to eight eggs are laid, white, and spotted with faint red. 74. l^IARSII TITMOUSE.\\u2014 (Ptfr/^? pduslris). Coal-head, Black-cap, \\\"Willow-biter. \\u2014 A plentiful species in places ; but as its name intimates, with a preference for districts with the peculiar low growth of bush and willow found in low fenny countries. It makes its nest in old willows and the low stunted trunks of pollard trees, and will labour hard to make a nearly suitable hole quite serviceable. It is said to carry the chips it makes quite away to some distance. The nest is better built than those of the Tits hitherto named, of moss and wool ; and the number of eggs varies from live or six to eight or even ten. They are of the usual Tom-tit type, white, spotted with red. 75. LONG-TAILED TITMOUSE.\\u2014 (Paras candatus.) Lcng-tailed Mag, Mum-ruffin, Bottle-tit, Bottle-tom, Longtailed Capon, Long-tail Pie, Caper Long-tail, Oven-buUder, Poke-pudding, Mulllin, &c., &c. \\u2014 The beautiful, even wonderful nest of this little bird must be well-known to almost all nestfanciers\\u2014 oval, of great size compared with the tuiy architect; built, too, entirely by the female, wondrously compacted with moss and wool, and \\\"sparkUng with lichens\\\" affixed to the outside, it affords access by one hole only, on the upper part of one side, to the inside most warmly lined with feathers. So 6(5 ~ BllITISH BIRDS, TITXni EGGS AND NESTS. thoroughly is it secured to the sticks which support it, that it is scarcely possible to obtain an entire one without cutting i.lie sticks for removal also. The eggs are often ten in number, and sometimes one or two more, wTiite, and very slightly specked with red, if at all. Wliat the little bird does with her long taD when sitting, is a marvel. The young, when able to fly, kecf. much together and with their parents ; and often, when at rest, sit very close together on one branch, so as to present a doubtfullooking feathery lump to the observer's eye. \\u2014 Fig. 17, plate III. 76. BEARDED TITMOUSE.\\u2014 (Par\\u00ab5 biarmicus). The male of this species ia, indeed, a beautiful bird. They ar& met with in sufficient abundance in many districts in England, e.g., about the Norfolk Broads, the Meres in adjacent counties, as well as in Surrey and Middlesex. Until lately, from the fenny nature of the soil of their habitat, they have been less observed than any other birds ; but now their habits are much better known. Their nest is often made of various finer sedges and the dead flag-like leaves of the reed with a little grass, and lined with the seed-down of the reed. Sometimes almost on theground, sometimes raised a little above it in a tuft of grass or reeds, on the margin of a ditch or other water, it contains four to six eggs, not so large as those of the Greater Titmouse, and of usual Titmouse colour and markings. \\u2014 Fig. 1 S, plate III.

GREY-HEADED AVAGTAIL. 67 VII. MOTAClLLIDJi:. 78. PIED WAGTAIL.\\u2014 (Ifo/anV/fl alba). TVliite Wagtail, Black and TVliite Wagtail, Dishwasher, Washtail, Nanny Washtail. \\u2014 I think we, aU of us, know this familiar and very graceful bird, and like to see its active run and short flight taken for the purpose of captm-ing an insect. We have often been amused, too, at seeing perhaps a wJiole family of young ones running among the legs of the cows near the water, and taking a fly now from the belly or flank of the great animal, and then from its leg or the ground. The nest is made of grass, bents, dead roots, moss, and is sometimes found in a hole in the rude wall of an old shed or the side of a haulm wall or pile of furze, or in a hole in a bank ; sometimes on the outside of a heap of sticks, or in thatch, or upon the end of a haystack, and other analogous places. Four or five eggs are customarily found in it, white, and speckled with cinereous spots and lines, being often such as to resemble one variety of the varying eggs of the House- Sparrow. \\u2014 Fig. 19, plate III. 79. GEEY WAGTAIL.\\u2014 (i\\u00a5o/ac///\\u00ab boarula). Less plentiful than the Pied Wagtail, equally elegant and more beautiful, this little bird resembles the other in its ways and habits. Its nest is placed on the ground at no great distance from water, which has many attractions for it, as well as for the common \\\" Naimy Washtail.\\\" The materials and general structure are, in the main, the same as in the last case ; feathers and wool being introduced as a lining. There are often five or six eggs in it, of a faint white ground-colour, mottled and jtreaked with very light brown, a few streaks being sometimes of a darker tint. \\u2014 Fig. 20, plate III. SO.

Yellow Wagtail, Cow-bird. \\u2014 A summer visitor, aad, of covrse, making its nest with us. It buUds on the ground, in cornfields or fallows ; sometimes on a stump of a tree level with the grouud, or on a bank of earth overhanging water, or in a hole in a wall in the same vieinity. The said nest is made of moss, roots, dry grass, and lined with the same, only finer, and a little hair. Four to six eggs are laid, which Mr. Yarrell says, \\\" are not un like those of the Sedge-Warbler, only rather larger ; whitish in colour, mottled nearly all over with yellow-brown and ashbrown.\\\" VIII.\\u2014 ANTIIIDiE. 82. TREE PIPIT.\\u2014 (^\\u00ab;/i\\u00ab5 arboreus). Pipit Lark, Pield Titling, Field Lark, Tree Lark, Grasshopper Lark. \\u2014 No long time elapses after the spring arrival of the Tree Pipit before he makes his presence observable by indulging in his peculiar mode of recommending his song, not unpleasant in itself, to our notice. Seated on the topmost twig of a tree or high busli he sings awhile, and then up he goes with fluttering wing, singing all the while, and also while descending from his greatest height on outstretched wing to the twig he started from. The nest is always on the ground, and not far from a hedge, or under a low bush, and is found also in woods or nurseries not far from the edge of a drive or glade. It is made of moss and fibres and grass, Ihied with finer grass and a little fiair. The eggs vary inconceivably in tint and marks, and entirely baflle description. Some are purple-red, others yellowishwhite in ground, clouded and spotted almost all over with different shades of Ki^Gyish brown. \\u2014 Fiij. 22, 23, plaie III. KOCK npii. 69 83. MEADOW VIVlT.\\u2014iJnihus praiensis). Titlark, Pipit Lark, Meadow Titling, Moor Tit or Titling, lleatlier-Lintie, Moss-Cheeper, Ling bird. Meadow Lark. \\u2014 A verv common bird here, both in the enclosed lands and especially on the moors. It is amusing to observe how they sometimes wind their way among the Img, instead of flying from the place at which they have alighted. Its nest is always on the ground, sometimes in the middle of a grass or corn-Geld, sometimes nearer the hedge, but always so placed as to be very well if not very closely concealed. One I found accidentally on the moor was in the side of a cavity left by the extraction of a huge surface block of stone, in a kind of small hollow or recess, and completely covered in by earth and ling. In addition to its five proper eggs, this nest contained a Cuckoo's tg'^. The nest is made of bents, lined with the same and some hairs. Tlie eggs are from four to sLx, and vary in colour. Mr. Yarrell's descri|)- tion is, \\\" of a reddish Iwown colour, mottled over with darker brown.\\\" The red is hardly discoverable, if at all, in some I have, and I should have said \\\"dusky brown.\\\" \\u2014 Fig.2\\\\, plate III. 84. ROCK VlVVY.\\u2014{AniInis petrosus). Dusky Lark, Rock Lark, Eicld Lark, Sea Titling, Sea Liutie. This bird, it seems, was long confounded with the two last. It is seldom met with far inland, and is not always found near rocks, notwithstanding its name. It is a ground-builder, and where there are rocks handy, the nest is very likely to be oa their ledges, if only a little grass or the like grows there. It is composed of various diy grasses, and contains four or five eggs of a greenish cast, and mottled with dusky brown or da'is cinereous markings. 85. RICHARD'S '^lVlT.\\u2014{Anthus Ricardi).

Lark, Field Lark, Lavrock. \\u2014 Very few words of description are requisite in the case of tliis everywhere famihar and favouiite Bongster. Up in the sky, and soaring still, he pours out his joyous strains, suggesting to us much more forcibly than any other bird does in its song the thought that it is offering praise and thanks to Him who made and preserves the fowl that fly in the air, as well as all other creatures. So that the thought in the old German Hymn, \\u2014 \\\" Hark ! Hark ! the Lark at Heaven s gate sings,\\\" seems not fanciful to us, but solemn truth. Once last summer 1 \\u25a0was speaking the solemn words, \\\" dust to dust, ashes to ashes,\\\" over a dead parishioner, followed as they so soon are by the telling of our \\\" sm-e and certain hope of a joyful resurrection,\\\" when a Sky Lark, right over our heads, broke out into his sweet, simple, thankful, hopeful, joyous melody, and by it spoke to more sad hearts than one in that sQent company. Up, up, to the skv was Ids pathway, and the song and the soaring both said tliat a \\\"joyful resurrection\\\" was no \\\" cunningly devised fable.\\\" The Sky Lark's nest is always on the ground, often near the edge of a furrow, sometimes near a little grassy unevenness of the surface, sometimes even, cunningly concealed in a dry grassy grip by the side of a field at the foot of a low hedge-bank. It is but a slight and inartificial structure, of bents lined with finer grasses and a few fibrous roots. The eggs, which I never knew WOOD LAHK. 71 to exceed five in number, vary as much in general colour and markings as the Tree Pipit's and quite baffle verbal description. I found three in a nest two years ago, altogether dusky in general iiue and so dark that I can hardly use the word brown in describing the shade ; wliile generally \\\" dark grey\\\" and \\\" ash brown \\\" will succeed in conveying an idea of the mottliugs characterising the egg. Besides which, by no means a small proportion of a large collection of Sky Lark's eggs wUl always be found to show a prevaiUng tinge of green in the sui-face colouring. The Lark is a very faitliful mother, and will not easily be induced to leave her nest ; and even when the nest has become quite untenable longer, from any cause, the parent birds have been known to move both eggs and young to a safer place, by grasping them with the long prehensile claws of their feet. \\u2014 Fi^. 24, plaie III. 88. TYOOD LARK\\u2014 (Ala uda ardorea). The Sky Lark is seen everywhere; on the moors here in small parties, on the Saltings ia Essex and other southern counties, in our meadows and corn-fields all over the kingdom. The TVood Lark, on the other hand, is strictly local, though sufficiently abundant where it does occur. I knew, in one case, where a shot was fired at a lot of Larks in the snow, that out of five or six which were kiUed all but one proved to be Wood Larks. So local is it, that though I have been a resident in Essex, Suffolk, Cambridgeshire, Herefordshire, Berwickshire, anc' Yorkshire, as well as a visitor in other counties, I have never lived among or near its haunts, saving ordy in the western-most county named. The nest is formed on the ground, usually well concealed by grass or a neighbouring scrubby bush, is composed of dry grass and moss, and lined with fibres and a few hairs. The eggs are four or five in number, of a lighter ground-colour (but 12 BRITISH I3I11DS, THEIR EGGS AND NESTS. scurcely less ia size) than those of the Sky Lark, vary very little comparatively in their general appearance, and often in addition to the ash brown or greenish hue of the superficial frecklings and mottlings, are marked by the presence of a few wine-red blotches. Tlie young are much sought for to keep in cages, as they soon begin to sing very freely. The song of the Wood Lark in a state of nature is one of the sweetest, in some respects, with wliich I am acquainted. \\u2014 Fi_^. ^o, plate III. 89. SHORT-TOED 'LK^Y.\\u2014{Alatida hrachydadyla).

Tawny Bunting, Mountain Bunting, Snow-flake or-fleck. \\u2014 Only a winter visitor in tliis country, though often coming in not very scanty numbers. I have frequently seen tlicm on our North Yorkshire moors, and liave heard of tliem as seen in flocks of large dimensions. One informant told me he had seen as many as two hundred together. It breeds in countries very far to the North, and, like otlier indigenes of the North, is subject to considerable variations in colour according to season. So much so, that the bii'd which used to be called Tawny Bunting in its summer plumage, was re-christened by the name of Snow Bunting, to suit its winter dress, wliile the young bird was called by tlio name of Mountain Bunting. 92. COMMON BUNTING\\u2014 (ff^/im^a miliaria). Bunting, Coi-n Bunting, Ebb. \\u2014 The name of this bird shows BLACK-HEADED BUNTING. 73 that it is not by any means rare in perhaps most of our country districts. It often utters its not very musical cry seated on a tall spray in a hedge, and sometinies wliile flying along. The nest is always made very near the ground, if not actually on it, usually among stunted bushes or coarse herbage. It is made of roots, bents or coarser materials yet, and lined M-ith hair. The Bunting lays four or five eggs, of a kind of stained- white ground, suggesting the idea that a vinous-red stain has been imperfectly washed off, and blotched and streaked and speckled, in the characteristic Bunting style, with sliades of purplish brown, some of them rather dark. Though called Com Bunting, it may be found where corn-fields are not abundant. I once met with a nest at the foot of St. Abb's Head.\\u2014 /'/y. 1, plate IF. 93.

On the Essex marshes it is common enougli, and so it is in the marshy or illdrained meadows of other counties. Mr. Yarrell says the \\\" nest is jreneraUy placed on tlie ground, among coarse long grass or rushes, at the foot of a thorn, or on the side of a canal bank.\\\" The last I found was among, and sapported by, the sedges growing at the side of a marsh-ditch in Essex, and not less than ten or twelve inches from the bank \\u2014 a site which I believe is not an unusual one. It is made of grasses, fragments of rushes, stalks of diffcTcnt plants, and lined sometimes with rred-dowm, or finer grasses and a little moss. I dislodged the male l)ird from the nest just named, and the eggs were perfectly warm to tiie touch. They would have been hatched in a few days. It was 74 BRITISH BIRDS, TU\\u00a3IR EGGS AND NESTS. thus proved that the male E,eed Bimting takes his share in sitting, and tlie position of the nest among green and growing sedges adds one more fact to what is known of its nidiflcation. The eggs are four or five in number, of a pale reddish-brown colour, streaked and spotted with dark brown of a rich purple shade. \\u2014 Eig. 3, plate IF. 94.

Por there is certainly no lack of Yellow Hammers all over the country ; and if one looks at the long strings of blown birds' eggs festooned at cottage doors, or hung over the cottage or farm-house mantel-piece, the trophies of some yotuig nest-taking hopeful dwelling there, after the Blackbirds' and Thi-ushes' eggs, the most abundant are almost always those of the Yellow Hammer. We all know his rich plumage and somewhat plaintive song, which, in my school-boy days, used to be Englished into \\\" A very, very little bit of bread and n-o-o c-h-e-e-e-s-e ! \\\" It does not spare materials when engaged in building its nest. Dead grass, small sticks and moss, a fcT? feathers and plentiful hair to form the lining, are ready enough in our fields for its use, and the structure compacted with them is placed usually in a low, thick bush on a hedge-bank, well concealed, and but little raised above the soil. Sometimes I have found it in a rough grass-field, amid tufts of rushes and other such-like growth. Sometimes even in a wall-tree, as in my own ;;uden last year ; or in an evergreen shrub, also in my garden a CHAFFINCH. /5 year or two since. But the hedge side is the rule. The eegs, tiiree to fh'e in number, and often very round in shape, vary considerably in individual cases, but never so much as to leave the accustomed eye in a moment's doubt as to what bird the egp; belongs to. Of a white ground-colour, scarcely tinged at ali with vinous red, or perhaps much suffused, all of them are streaked and veined and spotted with dark, brown with a shade of red in it. They are beautiful eggs to my eye. \\u2014 Fig. 3, plate IK. 95. GIRL BUNTING\\u2014 (^;;<imr\\u00ab cirlus).

Still it is by no means a very common bird, \\u2014 though identified as occurring in, perhaps, most of the southern counties. Tlie Rev. Orpen Morris, from whose work on British Bnds and Eggs 1 have taken the two provincial names given above, says, \\\" the ne&t is placed in furze or low bushes, and is usually made of dry stalks of grass and a little moss, liued -uith hair and small roots.

It would be a shame if he, with his gay dress and handsome appearance, were the bachelor he is called in his Latin name. It is, however, only at one period of the year that the sexes in the Cliaffinch tribe (as in many other kinds of birds) separate. The song of tlie Cliaffinch, though not of great compass or variety, is very cheery and sweet, and very different from his melancholy sound of \\\" Weet, weet,\\\" which many country people take as a prognostication of rain ; \\u2014 whence his local name of Wet-bird. The nest, always in a tree-fork or bush or hedge, always firmly and securely built in, always contrived and fashioned with a wonderful compactness, neatness and beauty, is formed of mosses, with various-shaded lichens on the surface, and lined with wool and hair and feathers, the last two being the finishing substances. I never knew more than five eggs to be laid, oftener four, of a peculiar winy-red dun, spotted and streaked \\u2014 and most near the large end\\u2014 with a rich, dark Sienna brown.

And even yet it has not been satisfactorily proved to have occurred in much more than half a dozen counties in England. Further observation may do more yet in identifying the Tree Sparrovr and defining its localities. It nests in holes in pollard or otlier trees, or in thatch, in company with other Sparrows of the common species, but in this case always in holes entered from the outside, not from the inside of tlic roof of the building. Sometimes it has been ascertained to breed in nests made within deserted nests of a Magpie, or some such bird. The nest, like that of the Common Sparrow, is formed of dry grass or hay, or flue straw, and abundantly lined with feathers of all sorts. ITie eggs, four or five in general, are distinctly less than those of the House Sparrow, and with more decided brown in the markings on the ground-colour of soiled white. \\u2014 Fig. 6, jilate IV. 100. HOUSE S7AKR0W\\u2014 {Passer domesticus). Sparrow, Common Sparrow. \\u2014 He may well be called the Common Sparrow, for we find him alike in the town and the country, in the field and in the garden, by the road-side hovel or in the neighbourhood of the great mansion. And whether he be sooty and blacK with the smoke of mid-London, or with his colours pure and unsmirched and bright as in the clear breezy village, he *\\u25a0 is stiU always the same pert, impudent creature, whose name has passed almost into a proverb for bold familiarity. Ubiquitous as he is by habit and system, his nest is found in sites almost as various and as numerous us, the places of his residence. Under the tUes or eaves of buildings, in the thatch-edges of a bam, in holes in the interior of a thatch-roof, in water-pipes and receivers for eaves-gutters, in holes in walls or old buildings, in ivy clothing either a wall or a tree, in fir trees, in wall-trees, especially if large and high, below Rooks' nests, in deserted ucsls of large 78 BRITISH BIRDS, TUEIR EGGS AXD NESTS. birds, \\u2014 frequent in all these sites, it seem diflicult to say where it may not be found. Often, too, it becomes a mass of straw and dry grass and lavish feather-lining, big enough to fill a man's hat of large size. The eggs are very various in the intensity of their surface markiugs. They are white, speckled and spotted and streaked with ash colour and dusky brown, some so slightly as to be pale grey, others so profusely as to be very dark \\\" pepper and salt.\\\" They vary in number from four to sis. Whenever the nest is bmlt in a situation naturally open at top, it is domed over by the little constructor. \\u2014 Fig. 7, plate IF. 101. GKSiE^l^mCR\\u2014^Coccothrauites chloris). Green Grosbeak, Green Linnet, Green Bird. \\u2014 A sufficiently common species, and often seen in wiater, in stubbles wliich afford a sufficiency of the seed-constituents of its food, in large flocks. Neither does it yield an insignificant portion of the egg spoUs of the country-boy. The nest is usually built in a hedge, and it dearly loves a thick massive thorn hedge for the purpose. In one such, bordering an orchard in Essex, of perhaps seventy or eighty yards long, I found one day a dozen or more of Greenfinches' nests, almost aJl with eggs in. It is, however, not seldom to be met with in an evergreen or other bush in tne garden ; sometimes in a fir tree, and again in a fruit or ornamental tree. The materials employed are roots, moss, grass, with a lining of the same, only finer, and plentiful hair. I have often noticed the presence of a kind of scrubby scales about the interior of one of their nests. The eggs are four, five, or six. in number, and vary much in size and but little in general appearance. They are white, suffused with a bluish tinge, and with reddish or purple spots and streaks, intermingled with some of a darker shade. \\u2014 Fig. 8, plate IV. GOLDFINCH. 73 102.

It is not uncommon about Epping Eorest, and has been found nearer London, and in many of the Southern counties. Mr. Doubleday has given the best account of its habits generally, as well as of its nest and eggs. It seems to have no peculiar situation for its nest preferred to all others, but builds indiscriminately in trees or bushes, and at various heights from the ground. The nest is said to be made of twigs, \\\" with fibrous roots and grey lichens laid flat on them;\\\" the whole structure being such as to remind one of the Ring-dove's flat platform of a nest. The eggs \\\" vary from four to six, and are of a pale olivegreen, spotted with black, and streaked with dusky grey.\\\" ]\\\\Ir. Doubleday adds, that some are much less marked than others.

It is much sought after for keeping in cages, and is caught for that purpose in numbers by the professional bird-catchers. It builds a beautifully neat and pretty nest ; sometimes in a bush or evergreen, often in the fork of an apple or other fruit-tree, and more rarely m a hedge. It is formed of moss, fir-needles, green bents, wool, thistle-dowTi, willow-down, feathers, hairs, &c., according to the choice afforded by the locality of the nest. The eggs are four or five in number, are bluish white or pale grey, spotted 80 BRITIsn BIRDS, TUER EGGS AND NESTS. with greyish purple and red bro^ni, and sometimes a little streaked with the same. \\u2014 Fig. 10, plate IV. 104.

The male in his full plum.age, with red poll and rose breast and bright brown plumage, is a handsome bird, and, compared with the female or the young, a very \\\" fine bird\\\" indeed. It is common enough in most districts, and pretty sui-e to be met with where there is much furze. The nest is frequently to be found in the midst of thick furze covers ; but like Mr. Ilewitson, I have found it commonly in thickish thorn-hedges, and very often in small and single furze bushes. It is made of small twigs and bents and moss, and often lined with a copious cushion of woo) merely; at other times, with some hair and vegetable down. The eggs vary greatly in size, as well as in colour and markings, but usually they are of a pale bluish-white ground, speckled with red of different shades, brown to pui-ple. They are four, five, and sometimes six in number. \\u2014 Fig. 11, plate IF. lOG. MEALY IlEDPOLE\\u2014 (Zjwoifa canetcens).

The nest seems to be built in some situation not too high above the ground ; for instancej in a bush or stunted tree ; and is made of moss and bents, and like some of those of the Common Linnet, with wiUow-down and the like. There are usually four or five eggs deposited in it, their colour \\\" pale bluish green, spotted with orange-brown, and principally at the larger end.\\\" The ground colour seems to vary to greenith-grey, and the spo*s to become more of a reddish tinge. \\u2014 Fi/j. 12, plate IV. 108.

It is known to breed in Yorkshire and the northern English counties as well as in Scotland, the Hebrides, &c. As its name leads one to infer, it is usually found in the neighboui-hood of hill or fell. The nest is built on the ground, among the short benty grass of the hiU-side or the dwarf ling of similar localities, or even among longer heather, and is made of the materiab afforded by such herbage, and moss, and lined with fibrous roots, wool and hair. The eggs vary from four to six in number, are ahnost white with the faintest blue or green tinge, spotted with red, brown or dark purple, with sometimes a few streaks of a lighter red tinge. \\u2014 Fig 13, plate IF. 109.

The Bullfinch is also one of those birds who have long been laid under proscription, for the mischief he is assumed to do to the buds of fruit trees. Lilvc as rewards used to be customarily paid in hosts of places out of the Parish funds for the heads of SpaiTOws, Tomtits, &c., so has it been on a lesser scale with our present birds, and I cannot help thinking equally unjustly. No doubt the \\\" Olph\\\" commits sad apparent havock on the blossom-buds ; but I suspect the blossom-buds damaged by him (as it seems) would never have come to anything if no Bullfinoh had ever been near them. There was a grub in each of tliem, and that grub would have destroyed the bud quite as effectually, if not qmte as summarily, as the bird which extracted it from what was alike its hiding-place and scene of active ravage and consumption. Unlike the Ping Dove and Missel Thrush, and a few other birds, which are usually very wild and shy, but at breeding time lay aside their wildness and distrust, and come to the close neighbourhood of human habitations to nest, the Bullfinch, in spring, leaves our gardens and orchards and resorts to the woods and wilds. The nest is made of twigs and roots and moss, rather loosely constructed, and lined with wool and hair, and is most commonly placed in a good thick bush of considerable height Mid size ; sometimes on a fir or other tree. The hen-bird lays four or five eggs of a pale greenish blue, streaked and spotted M-ith purple-red, chiefly at the larger end. \\u2014 Firj. 1^, plate IF. 110.

This is a bird which deserves a little notice at our hands on two or tliree grounds. In its plumage it varies more, according to sex or age, than perhaps any other English bii'd in a state of nature. It is kideed subject to almost startling dissimilarity. The peculiar shape and action of the bill is also noteworthy, and the strengtli of the muscles which move the mandibles may be judged of by the powerful effect produced m startiag the scales of the strongest fir-cones. Again, it has been repeatedly met mth in this country in large numbers ; and not only so, out at such seasons as to render it almost positive, that it must have nested, or be nesting here : nay even females which were obtained showed, by the state of their plumage, that they must have been so engaged : and yet until recently, no authentic observation has been recorded of the actual occurrence of its nest and eggs. It is now believed to breed in the very earliest spring or indeed in winter, which may account for the obscurity hiiherto attending its nesting habits. The nest is made of twigs below, with grassy bents upon such foundation, bound together with wool and lined with hair. The eggs seem to vary much in colour, showing a sensible degree of resemblance to those of the Greenfinch, but with a generally warmer tint, and spots of a much more decided or dark red shade. \\u2014 Fig. 15, plate IF. 112.

Common Starling, Stare, Sheep-stare, Solitary Tlirush, BroAnti Starling. \\u2014 Ttie two last of these names used to be applied to the young of the Starling. Tew cases of more brUliant Tihimage are met with in our English birds than in the instance of the male of the Common Starling. The metallic glow and play of colours in the feathers of his head, neck and back is very beautiful. It is a very abundant bird, and it is supposed by some that there are some peculiarities in its breeding habits. I mean that I have heard it asserted that the male is a polygamist, or rather perhaps a bigamist. I never saw any thing within my own scope of observation which led me to suspect it, but rather to hold the received belief that the Starling pairs exactly as most other birds do. They are exceedingly pertinacious in adhering to their clioice of a place for nesting in. I knew one case in which from the inconvenient nature of the nest-site selected, one of the birds was shot. In a very short space the survivor had paired again, and the gun again dissolved the union. The whole process was repeated five or six times, and the Starlings bred at last in the place chosen by the original pair. The nest is found in a great variety of situations, \\u2014 in the bowl of a water pipe from the eaves of a house, in a dove-cot, in holes in trees, below the nests in a rookery, in holes in old buildings or more recent masonry, between the slates and underdrawing of a roof, in holes in steep high rocks, in chimneys of houses, and the like. It is made, without stint of materials, of straw, roots, grass, and a plentiful lining of feathers. The eggs, four to six in number, vary strangely in size but not in colour, which is of a uniform pale blue. In some districts where the Starling abounds, they collect in huge flocks, the youn^' HAVEN. 85 with the parents, and may be seen when on the wing like a cloud from a great distance. \\u2014 lig. 1, plate V. 11\\u00a3 KOSE-COLOURED PASTOR\\u2014 CPas^r roseus).

In the Isle of Wight, in Man, on the Cornish shores, at Flamborough, in Berwickshire near St. Abb's Head, it is still (or was till lately) knou-n to breed. \\\"This bird,\\\" says Mr. YarrcU, \\\"makes a nest of sticks lined with wool and hair, in the cavities of high cliffs, or in old castles, or church towers near the sea ; laying four or five eggs of a yellowish white colour, spotted with ash-grey and light brown.\\\" \\u2014 Fig. 2, flnte V. 117.

Persecuted by the gamekeeper, sought after for domestication, or their eggs taken for sale to the collector, they are becoming very rare in many a part of the country where not long Bince they were frequently seen.

I did it in jeopardy however, for the Ravens were very bold, and every moment I expected they would assail me, ia spite of the short bludgeon I had suspended to my wrist. Ths appearance below the nest of the farmer in whose fields the Raveu tree grew, decided the question \\u2014 perhaps he frightened tlie Ravens as weU as threatened me ; perhaps they knew he came as their protector \\u2014 anyhow I did not get my egg, although I had actually liad it in my hand. The nest is a great pile of sticks, lined with wool and roots and felts of hair, and often has four or five eggs laid in it, of a light green ground-shade, blotched and spotted with browns of varying depth of colour, but some of them very dark. \\u2014 Fig. 3, Tplate V. 118.

Waterton calls him his \\\" Warrior bird\\\"), and a young and weakly lamb, a young Hare or Rabbit, a wounded or frightened Partridge has little or no chance with him. I knew a case a year or two since of a Crow attacking a Partridge and driving it to cover in a hedge, where it lay so terrified and exliausted as to suffer itself to be picked up by a spectator. I knew another instance years ago iu which the Crow attacked a young Rabbit. The old doe came to the assistance of her young one, and the 'oattle was well contested, but tlie Crow was the victor, and carried off the spoil. ROCK. 87 Paired once, these birds, as in the case of the Raven, are paii-ed for good. The nest is placed in a main fork of a large tree, and is made of sticks and twigs with abundant cushioning of wool and hair. It is believed not to bmld a new nest every year. It lays four or five eggs, varying much in the depth of the tiut of the greenish ground-colour, and generally weU mottled and blotched and spotted with greenish ash colour and bright brown. The parents seem to expel their young from the immediate precincts of their own abode very soon after they are able to provide for themselves ; as is the case with the Raven also. \\u2014 Fig. 4, 'plate V. 119.

It has been very seldom known to breed in England, though coming m great abundance from its more northern haunts before the access of winter. In north and west Scotland, the Hebrides and Orkneys it breeds in large numbers, and rewards for its destruction have been customarily paid to within a recent period, if indeed they have altogether ceased yet. They place their nests among rocks, in the rifts or on ledges. These are built of ling, sticks, roots, stalks of plants, seaweed ; and lined with wool and hair. There are usually four or five eggs, not differing very materially in colouring from those of the Common Crow. \\u2014 Fig. 5, flate V. 120. ROOK\\u2014 ( Corrws frugilegus) .

In the country some of the most familiar sights aud sounds are those afforded by the Rookery, or by tlie huge assemblages of Rooks about the fields or winging their morning or evening lliglit in quest of food, or in return to their domiciles. Most of us too have heard of Rook courts of justice, and the sentences awarded against the ^vrongful spoilers of a neighbour's nest, as well as the battles to resist such an invasion. It is ce?-tauily a remarkable instinct, wliich, to so great a degree, forbids birds building in communities to pliuider the building materials placed on the adjoining bough or ledge, and no wonder that Instinct has provided a remedy for what must be looked upon, when it occurs to any extent, as a somewhat unnatural offence. The Rook resorts to the same nest year after year, merely making such repairs as a year's wear and tear from wind and rain and accident nave rendered necessary. When the nest is ready, four or five eggs are deposited, of a greenish ground-colour more or less intense in shade, plentifully mottled and blotched with darker \\u2022jnd varying shades of brownish green. Many of the eggs strongly resemble tliose of the Crow, while others are much more like those of the Jackdaw. As in the case of the Bullfinch tlie Rook is often blamed for doing mischief which was really done by the creature which formed tlie real object of search to the supposed offender. The wireworm and the grub of the cockchafer do infinite damage in grass or cornfields by eating ofi the roots of the plants in question. Tiie Rook pulls up these ruined plants ajid eats the offending larva. The farmer or supcrucial observer only sees the dead grass or com plant, and loolishly accuses the Rook, and persecutes him, though in reality a friend and benefactor, to the death. Not but what the Rook does niLseblef at times ; for I have often seen newly sown corn-fields MAGPIE. 89 black with them, and have bccu coutiuually a witness to the very extensive damage done to the potato crop just when the young tubers were in most active growth and most susceptible of harm. Still, a few precautions will suffice to protect both cornlejQ and potato-crop during the brief space while protection is necessary, and the balance of good done is so greatly on the preaoininaling side, that the Rook may well continue to be protected. Rook shooting has charms for many. For myself I seem to see cruelty so conspicuous about the whole process, that I cannot conceive in what the pleasure consists. \\u2014 'Eig. 6, ]plata V. 121. JACKDAW\\u2014 (Cw^w^ monedula). Daw, Kae, Jack. \\u2014 The chattering Jackdaw is as familiar as a \\\"Household word\\\" to us, and when one visits an extensive colony of Jackdaws in the nesting season, he is apt to be enabled to form a good estimate of the amount of chatter a few score Jackdaws can contribute. They breed in many places in the immediate neighbourhood of my residence in very considerable numbers, in the holes and crevices which abound among craggy rocks and precipices that rise high above steep wooded banks. Besides, they build in ruinous buildings, in church towers of pigeon-houses, in little used chimneys, in holes in modern masonry, even in deserted chambers. The pile of materials amassed is simply wonderful, and really they are sometimes so laid together as if intended to serve no other purpose but to lengthen out the nest-pile for a builder's amusement. Sticks and wool are the substances usually employed, and the eggs laid vary, as to number, between three and sii. They are of a pale bluish-white, well spotted with ash colour light brown and dark brown. \\u2014 lig. 7, plate V. 122. IklAGPIE\\u2014 (PiVa cauda(a).

It is almost idle to say no such variety or distinction really exists. The materials of the nest are cliiefly sticks, plastered with earth inside, and lined with roots and hair. There are often as many as six or seven eggs laid in it, pale bluish-white in colour, spotted all over, and abundantly so in general, with grey and greenish brown of more than one shade. \\u2014 Fi/g. 8, plate V. 123. JAY \\u2014 {Garrulus glandarius). Jay-pie, Jay-piet. \\u2014 The Jay's peculiar screeching note is perhaps more familiar to many ears than the bii'd itself to the eyes corresponding to the said ears. It is a shy bii'd, seldom, seen far from its haunts in woods and copses, though when seen, it is noticeable enough from a certain peculiarity in its flight, due to a sort of fluttering use or motion of its wings. It is easily domesticated, and b?.conics a tame and amusing pet. The nest is very often extremely rude and inartificial, almost as much so as the Ring Dove's. It is placed in the upper part of a lofty bush in a wood, or on some one of the lateral oranches of a tree where the height from the ground is considerable'; is made of sticks and GREEN WOODPECKER. 91 liued with roots ; the cavity containing the eggs often seeming to be not very considerable.

I have no idea of the origin or etymology of either form, but I have given these names generally in the thought that they may be helpful to some, and interesting to other young egg-collectors. The Green Woodpecker is the most common, and much the best known of all our English Woodpeckers. Besides being a very handsome bird, its organization (as is indeed the case with aU the tribe) is so beautifully adapted to its mode of life, as to merit a brief notice at our hands. Its strong prehensile feet and claws, two toes being directed forward and two backwards, fit it not only for moving in all directions, and with wonderful readiness and ease in any direction whatever, about the trunk or limbs of a tree, but also for grasping the surface with great tenacity when necessity arises 92 UKITISII BIIIDS, TUEIK KGGS AND NESTS, for applying its strong bill to penetrating or disloding either bark or portions of the wood itself. When thus occupied, the tail comes into use, and the bones at the lower extremity of the skeleton are so formed as to enable the stifT, pointed tail-feathers to be appHcd to the tree in such a way as to strengthen the purchase already obtained by the firm foot-hold. Add to all this the length of the tongue, its great extensibility, specially provided for by a peculiar arrangement of muscles, together with the structure of the tongue itself \\u2014 remarkable for its sharp, horny tip and barb like bristles on either side near the point \\u2014 and we Lave one of Nature's most beautiful accommodations of means to the intended end which can well be offered to our admiring notice . The undulating flight and laugh-like cry of the Green Woodpecker used to be more common than they seem to be now, and the great multiplicity of provincial names seems to show that once it must have been an exceedingly common bh-d. I have rarely seen or heard it here : and no wonder. For where once there were mUcs of forest, now we have scarcely 100 acres of wood in the whole district. This Woodpecker's cry is loudly and frequently uttered befoie unpending rain ; whence one of its common or by-names. It breeds in holes in trees, which it often excavates in part or enlarges to suit its wants. It makes no nest, but deposits its eggs, four to seven in number, and perfectly white, on a bed of the soft decayed wood of the tree. The eggs average rather over l|-inchin length, by about |-inch broad. Ko LUustration being possible in ouj: space of purely white eggs I tliink it better to append their measurements. 127.

It is less likely, too, to betray its presence by its note than the Green Woodpecker, and is so shy and so capable of, concealing itself or keepim:^ the tnink of a tree always between itself and any prying observer, that doubtless it is deemed to be more rare than it reully is. It seems to prefer the vicinity of woods, but may be seen occasionally where woods do not abound, and sometimes even it resorts to places where abundance of old posts or decaying tree-trunks lead it to expect a plentiful repast. It breeds ia holes in trees, making no nest, and laying its four or five eggs on just such a bed as its green namesake.

It is said to prefer large woods of Beech ; and like the other Woodpeckers, makes no nest, but places its eggs in a hoUow tree, accessible by only a small hole, the means of access being often at a considerable distance from the eggs laid below. The eggs of this little bird are four or five in number, purely white, though seeming to be suffused with a delicate pink hue before they are blown, which arises from the transparency of the ihell. They are about l-inch long by rather more than |-inch broad. 129. ^YRYKF.CK~(runx torquilla).

We willingly pardon its want of melody for its associations. The marvellous rapidity with which its tongue is darted out and retracted, enabling it by the aid of the glutinous secretion with which its end is furnished to secure an Ant at every action, is highly interesting as illustrating another of the wonderful and beautiful adaptations provided by the Divine Artificer of all The Wryneck makes scarcely any nest (if any), but lays its eggs on the fragments of decayed wood which Ime a hole in a tree. They are from six to ten in number, and white and glossy, and about the same size as those of the Barred Wood-pecker. The old bu-d is singularly unwilling to leave her eggs under any intrusion, and tries by such means as hissing sharply, elevating her crest and contorting her neck, to intimidate or deter the intruder. II.\\u2014 CERTHIADJ2. 130. CRYEVER\\u2014iCeri/iia familiaris). Tree-creeper, Tree-climber. \\u2014 A shy, gentle-seeming little bird, shunning observation, and, with the rest of its neighbours in our catalogue, possessing a singular facility of quietly and rapidly shiftuig its place on the trunlc or limb of a tree, so as always to interpose an efficient screen between its own minute body and the eye of any passer-by. Its claws, sharp and long and curved, aided by its long and pointed tail-feathers, are its chief machinery in these facile motions. It builds its nest, generally speaking, in a hole in a tree, with only a very minute aperture. Sometimes, though I think rarely, the nest is outside the tree, but screened from observation by some casual dislodgement of the bark, or in some similar way. It is made of dry grass, small twigs, shreds of moss, with a lining of feathers. It is very hard to distinguish Oft between the eggs of the Creeper, which number from six to nine, and those of the Blue Tit-mouse and the Willow-wren, not to mention one or two other small birds. The illustration will give a better idea of the egg than many lines of description. \\u2014 Fij. 16, fLate IV. 131. y^^^l^\\u2014 [Troglodytes vulgaris). Jenny Wren, Kitty Wren, Titty Wren, Cutty Wren.\\u2014 A kind of natural pet with every one. I scarcely ever remember to have spoken of the Wren, or heard others speak of it, without some gentle, loving epithet applied to its name. The provincial names quoted are instances of what I mean, and how often the words \\\"poor,\\\" \\\"little,\\\" \\\"tiny,\\\" and even \\\"dear,\\\" are jomed to the ;)refixes of Jenny, or Kitty, or Titty. Its little song, its seeming incapacity to bear the rude buffets of storm and cold, its quiet peculiar movements, all tend to commend it to our kmdly notice. And then the beautiful nest it makes \\u2014 such a great pile for such a tiny builder \\u2014 and so compact and warm and wonderfully concealed by the use of the nicest adaptations of materials and design to the site selected, \\u2014 this makes us almost respectfully admire, in addition to our love. I have found it on the mosscovered bank, on the moss-covered trunk of a tree, in thatch, in a haulm wall ; but wherever it is found, the adjacent substances are made to help the concealment. One would think that when strength and ability, seemingly so inadequate, had been so heavily tasked as is implied in the construction of such a nest, the little birds would not be likely to leave it, especially with the bmlding of another in immediate prospect. But I have not found it so in practice. A very trifling enlargement of the single orifice, or straining of the fabric, in the effort to send the finger to the bottom of the nest, is quite sufficient to cause the nest to be deserted ; especially if the Wrens owning it have 9f> mUTISlf BIRDS, THEIR EGGS AND NESTS. once or more been disturbed when in it, or very near it. When the young ones are liatched, the case is altered. The eggs are often from six to nine or ten in number, and I liave heard of even more. They are white, with almost always a few pale red spots about them. The male is said to feed the female during the period of closest incubation. Many other bu'ds ccrtaiiJy have the same habit, even when the mate has left the nest just to stretch her wings, as it were. I have seen the Common Linnet do this. \\u2014 lig. 17, 'plate IV. 132. HOOPOE\\u2014 (C/>Ki;a e/)o;w.) A casual visitor only, but still not so rare that specimens are not obtained almost every year.

NUT-HATCH\\u2014 (&Y^\\u00ab Europcea). Nut-jobber, \\\"VVood-cracker. \\u2014 A very beautiful bird to my eye, with liis bright slate-coloured back, and orange breast, and black bill ; and a very great pet in former days. I had a pair which had never known a day of constraint, but wliich, by patient feeding and care to make them fearless of me, became so tame as almost to take food from my hand ; to take it readily when I jerked it a foot or two into the an-. And they would always come to my signal for them \\u2014 a few blows on the tree at which I fed them. But they never suffered their young to come to the feast I provided, and always absented themselves for about a month at the breeding time. The nest is, I believe, always made in the hole of a tree, and if the aperture to the hollow is too large, the bird is apt to lessen it by the application of a sort of mud-plaster to some portions of the edge. The nest is Ci.CKOO. 97 rather a eontiast tu that, of tlic little \\\"VVrcnjust named, being little more than a loose heap of moss, small twigs, aud chips of Dark and wood. The eggs are five or six and sometimes, it is said, seven in number, white, with some pale-red spots. Many of them are very like the Larger Titmouse's. \\u2014 T'uj. IS, plate IV.

Hearing the first Cuckoo and seeiug the first Swallow are always events to true lovers of country scenes aud objects and sounds. But what a strange instuict it is which forbids our Cuckoo to build a nest, and instructs it to lay its t^'^ \\u2014 at least to place it \\u2014 in some other bird's nest, and tha'>, bird usually not one-fifth its own size ! A Blackbird's nest is sometimes selected to receive the deposit, but very rarely compared with the Hedge Sparrow's, the Lark's, the ]\\\\Icadow Pipit's, the Water Wagtail's, or the Chaffinch's. How many eggs are laid by a single Cuckoo in a season, is, I think, not ascertained. It is, however, a very rare circumstance to find more than one Cuckoo's c^^ in any given nest, and then open to great doubt if both were placed there by the same Cuckoo. It is a matter of dispute how the ^2^^ is actually deposited in the nest selected ; whether \\\" laid\\\" in, or placed in \\u2014 after being dropped on the ground suppose \\u2014 by the bill or claws. I found one in the Meadow Pipit's nest mentioned above (p. 69), where the position and site of the nest were such as to leave no doubt whatever in my mind that the egg could not possibly have been \\\"laid\\\" in tJie nest ; and almost certAinlv inserted bv aid of the heal. How IHp (\\\"'ucAno 93 BRITISU BIRDS, THEIR EGGS AND NESTS. found such a nest at all, was a marvel to me. The eggs are verj' small for the size of the bird which produces them, and strongly resemble some of the darker and more closely freckled specimens of the House Sparrow's egg, but are ratlier larger in size; while Mr. Doubleday says some of them resemble those of the Pied WagtaW.\\u2014Fi^. 19, plafe 1 V. 135.

Beyond doubt, as far as exceeding brilliancy of plumage goes, the most beautiful of our indigenous birds. I have never seen it in any part of the kingdom a numerous bird, though in my fishing and other excursions in Suffolk, Essex, Norfolk, and Herefordshire, I used to see many pairs ; each, however, domiciled at some distance from its nearest neighbours. In the district of North Yorkshire I am best acquainted with I have never seen it. Its straight, arrow-like, speeding flight is sure to be remembeured, when once seen, and so is the odour inseparable from its nesthole or other stated haunt. A hole, sloping upwards, in the ^ank of the water it uaost frequents, whether jjond, stream. 99 marsh, dit.cii, or large river, is usually clioscu to receive the uest, which is often a foot and a half, or two feet from the entrance; but sometimes the bird has been known to resort to a hole at some distance from any water. The nest, so called, seems to be constituted of small fish-bones, ejected from the King-fisher's stomach, and the dry soil of the hole, while the eggs deposited in it are five or six in number, very round in form, beautifully white when blown, and though, from the thinness of the shell, seeming to have a pink hue before the removal of the yolk. ' III.\\u2014 HIRUNDINID^. 139. SWALLOW\\u2014 {Illniudo rustica). Common Swallow, House Swallow, Chimney Swallow, Bam Swallow. \\u2014 One of the most welcome of all our spring visitors ; and so frequently coming back, the self-same pair of birds apparently, to the self-same nest, that they seem to be almost like members of the family returnmg from a temporary absence. The common name. Chimney Swallow, is, however, rather a misnomer. No doubt they build in chimneys freely and frequently, but in many districts the chimney is quite untenanted by any Swallows, while the open roofs of sheds and barns, the under side of bridges sufficiently flat and uneven to afford the necessary support, disused shafts of mines, and the bice, and even parts of unused rooms, or articles of fui'uiture in such rooms, are resorted to. These nests are very considerably different from those of the Martin (to be noticed next), inasmuch as th(;y are always completely open above, being so built that there is a sensible space between the greater portion of tlie edge of the plaster-work of the nest, and the roof or other surface above ; whiie in the case of the Martin's nest, it is always bmlt so as to be closed above by the eaves or other ledge to which it is affixed, requiring a gap or 100 BRITIsn BIKDS, THEIR EGGS AND NESTS. lip \\u2014 SO to speak \\u2014 to be left in the wall to afford ingress and ejjress to the owners. The nest, in either case, is built with many peliets of soft tenacious earth, wrought into form with bits of straw or grass, and afterwards lined with feathers. It is observable that no more work at tlie nest is done in a day than wiU readily harden enough to bear tlie requisite additions of materials abov when the tune comes for making them. There are usually fou five, or six eggs laid; white, speckled and spotted with dee red, and a lighter duller shade, \\u2014 Fig. 20, plate IV. 140. MARIVN\\u2014iHirundo urbica). Martlet, Martin Swallow, House Martin, Window Martin Eaves Swallow, Window Swallow. \\u2014 This familiar little bird whose cheeping note in the nests above our chamber windows i? one of the sounds we should sorely miss, frequents the dwellings of men quite as much as, I think more than, the Swallow. Every one knows where to look for the Martin's nest, and many a house can we all call to mind which seems, from some peculiarity in its site or external fashion, to be particularly affected by these birds \\u2014 and certainly, in most cases, the imnates of the house take much care to save their confiding feathered friends from disturbance. In many places, however, the Martin forms large nesting colonies, which take possession of a series of overhanging ledges on some steep rocky face, and there build their nests in great numbers. In Berwickshire, on the banks of the Whiteadder, I knew of such a colony, and others elsewhere : the principal ones, however, being on the rock-bound coast between St. Abb's Head and Burnmouth. Hundreds of these birds nested in several different places upon those lofty precipices. No description of the nest itself \\u2014 beyond what was said in the notice of the Swallow \\u2014 seems requisite. The number of eggs, which are perfectly Mliite. seems seldom to exceed six. SWIFT. 101 141. SAND MAllTIN\\u2014 (///r\\u00ab\\u00abrfo riparia). Bank Martin, Pit Martin, Sand Swallow, Bank Swallow, River Swallow. \\u2014 This delicate little visitor cornea to us in the spring, often very early, from Africa, as do also the two others of the genus just named. Where it does occur \\u2014 and it is generally diffused \\u2014 it is often seen in very large numbers. A Ballast Pit at Fingringhoe, in Essex, is occupied by the most numerous colony I am acquainted with; and a site afforded by the surface beds of sand and sod above a steep scarp of rock on Tweed-bank, nearly opposite Norham Castle, used to accommodate another colony. Some of the holes are bored to a very great depth. I have enlarged the orifice of many tiU it would admit my whole shoulder, and liave tlien been unable to reach the termination of the gallery. Others are much shorter, and admitting of more easy access to the nest The female -will, notwithstanding the noise and violence attending the enlargement of the aperture of her nest-hole, sit resolutely on, and allow herself to be taken in the hand with scarcely a struggle or sign of resistance \\u2014 even of life, sometimes. One I took thus a year or two since lay in my open hand for a minute or more, and then at last flew only leisurely away. A little loose, soft straw, with some feathers, serves to receive tlie eggs, which are four to six in number, often much elongated in shape, of the most delicate white, and beautifully pink, from the thinness of the shell, before they are blown. 142.

It is most frequently seen at no great distance from some old tower of castle or church, or such like building, although at times it seems to range far in searcli of food. It makes its nest of pieces of soft straw, bents or grass or hay and feathers, and usually in holes in the buildings aforesaid, or between the tiles and underroof of houses ; and the nest once made is supposed to be used for many years in succession by the same pair of birds. It sometimes seems as if it had been cemented together in some way. The Swift often lays only two eggs, but has been known to produce three, and even four. They are quite white, and rather large for the size of the bird. 144. ALPINE SWlYT\\u2014iC^pselus Alpinus).

Coming from its retirement but very little and very reluctantly by day, and only pursuing its prey towards and during twilight, it is not by any means an obtnisive bird ; as little so, indeed, as any one of the Owls. But its loud churring or jarring note, as it wheels round a tree or clump of trees, is often enough heard by many a one to whom its form and size and plumage are nearly or utterly strange. It is. perhaps, most frequently met with where patches of furze and aiXQ DOVB 103 fern on open commons, not too far from the neighbourhood of plantations, occur. The Night-jar can hardly be said to make a nest ; but hiys two eggs in any slight natural depression of the ground whicli slie can find suiBciently near a bush or clump of whins to be at least partly concealed by it. Tlie eggs are very oval in shape, and very beautifully mottled and clouded and veined with varying tints of blueish iead-colour and browr\\\\, on a whitish ground. \\u2014 Fig. I, plate VI.

The eggs seem to be invariably very oval in shape, and purely wliite. They are 1^ inch long, by | inch broad. 147. STOCK T)OYE\\u2014(Columba anas). Stock Pigeon, Wood Pigeon, Wood Dove. \\u2014 This Dove is not only, generally speaking, much less abundant throughout the country than the Ring Dove, but very often, it would seem, confounded with it by casual observers, who only notice the several birds from a distance, or on the wing. They frequent the same roostiug-places, and often feed in the same field, thougli probably on different species of food. I have shot birds of both species at the same discharge of the gun, and have noticed the different matters which had supplied their meals of the day, \\u2014 Hollyberries, in the case of the Ring Dove ; wild mustard-seed, in the other. The Stock Dove is, however, immediately and easily distinguishable from the Ring Dove, by its lesser size, a slight difference in colour, and the entire absence of the \\\" ring \\\" of white feathers on the neck. Its nest is placed sometimes on pollard trees, sometimes in open holes or hollows in old trees ; and very commonly, in some districts, either on the ground Ijclow tluck furze-bushes, or in deserted rabbit-burrows, two or three feet distant from the entrance. The nest is very slight, consisting merely of a few twigs or roots. The eggs are two in number* pure wliite, about or rather exceeding \\\\\\\\ inch in length, by li inch in breadth. ROCK-DOVE\\u2014 (Co&\\u00bb23a livia). Wild Pigeon, Rock Pigeon, Wild Dove, Doo, Rockier. \\u2014 This Pigeon has usually, until not long since, beec confused with the TURTLE DOVE. 105 Stock Dove. But their plumage is unlike, their voice unlike, and especially their habits and living and breeding haunts unlike. It is believed with some certainty, that the Rock Dove is the reai \\u25a0origin of the Domestic Pigeon, and certainly any one who has -seen the large flight of Domestic Pigeons turned wild, which frequent the caverns in tlie rock-bound coast near St, Abb's Head and similar localities, living with, flying with, feeding with, and nesting with the undoubted wild Rockier, can entertain but very small doubts on the subject. The Ptock Dove makes a loose nest \\u25a0of twigs and plant-stems and dry grass ; very often far back in holes and crevices of the rock ; and lays two white eggs, with a much better defined \\\" big end\\\" and \\\" little end\\\" than in the case of the two Pigeons last named. 149. TURTLE DOYl^\\u2014(Colimba turiur.) Turtle, Common Turtle, Ring-necked Turtle, Wrekin Dove. \\u2014 Only a summer visitor and not a regular inhabitant, like its three predecessors. It is long since, living where I do, I have heard its sweet, plaintive note. No one but one who loves bnds and theii ways can tell how real a deprivation it is to live for years out ol sound of the sweet and familiar voices of such as are only local, the Nightingale for instance, the Turtle, and many others. The male Tnrtle Dove is a very handsome bnd, but much shier and more retiring at breeding-time than the Ring Dove. The nest is a light platform of sticks, easily permitting the sky to be seen through it from below, and usually placed high up in a holly, a thick bush in a wood, in the branches of a fir, or the lesser fork ol some limb of an oak or other forest tree. As with tiie other Doves, the eggs are two in number, quite white, about 1| inch long, by I broad. 150. PASSENGER 71GE0'^\\u2014(Echpisies migratorius). Every bird-loving boy, beyond doubt, has heard of this Pigeon 106 BIUIISH BIRDS, THEIR KGGS AND NESTS, and the inconceivable vastness of the flocks in which they pass from one distant district to another in America. Here it is only a casual visitor, and can lawfully lay claim to none of our limited space. II.\\u2014 PHASIANID.E. 151. PHEASANT\\u2014 (P^fl\\u00ab\\u00ab\\u00ab\\u00ab5 Colchlcus). I dare say \\\"a good few\\\" of our readers if they wers asked \\\" Do you know the Pheasant ?\\\" might answer, \\\" Yes, very well. We had some for dinner, such and such a day.\\\" And I have no doubt the acquaintance was satisfactory enough \\u2014 at least to one of the parties. The Plieasant docs not pair, and on the preserved estates in Norfolk and Cambridgeshire I have frequently seen ia the spring large groups of Cock Pheasants collected and consorting together without the intermixture of a single hen. In a vast many places now an artificial system of Pheasant-breeding is adopted, three or four hens with one male beuig turned into a large paled \\\" apartment,\\\" well netted in, the whole establishment comprising many such apartments. Each hen lays double or treble the number of eggs she would if suffered to run wild, and these are collected daily and placed ujider hens ready to sit as soon as a sufficient number is got together. In this way twice or three times the number of young ones is secured from one hen as compared with her own greatest success in bringing off a brood in the woods. In her w'M state, the Pheasant makes scarcely any nest, on the ground, \\\\uA lays ten or twelve eggs, of a uniform pale olivo-brown shade. Not only are cases in which two Pheasants lay in the same nest of by no means unfrequent occui-rence, but others even, in which Pheasants' eggs have been found in Partridges' nests. Many instances are on record of the Pheasant inter-breeding with other birds, such as the Gumea Fowl, tho BLACK GROUSE. 107 Black Grouse, and the Common Fowl. The cross last named is by no means uncommon, and a remarkably fine male specimen of the produce of a Cock Pheasant and Speckled Hamburg Hen occurred here (one of four birds wiiich were hatched) a few years since. The Pheasant's tail and iiead and general shape as well as fashion of feathers (with access of size) were united to the shades and markings of the plumage of the mother. The bird in question was so inveterate in his visits to the neighbouring farm-yard in order to challenge the Cocks who dwelt there, and so sm-e to kill them outright, or maim or maul them so severely that they had to be kUled, that it became necessary to put him out of the way himself, and his present memorial is liis remarkably well-stuffed skin. \\u2014 Fit/. 2, plate VI.

Cock of the Woods, Wood Grouse, Cock of the Mountain, Great Grouse, Capercailzie, Capercally. \\u2014 An indigenous inhabitant of this country, but one which had become, or was becoming, extinct, a few years ago. Now it is becoming comparatively abundant again on the estates of several large and noble owners, principally m Scotland. It is indeed a very noble bird, and well wortliy the care and attention and expense which have been devoted to the attempt to re-establish it. The female makes her nest on the ground, and lays from six to ten or twelve eggs. These are of a pale reddish-yellow bro\\\\vn, spotted all over with two shades of darker orange brown. \\u2014 Fir/. 3, plate VI. 153. BLACK GROUSE\\u2014 (Je^rao (etria:).

In fact, the gradual and very complete demolition of the last remains of what were once very extensive forests has completely banished the Black Grouse from places where it used to be common within the memory of living men. It is a very handsome bird, and like the Capercailly and the Pheasant, does not pair. The hen makes a very slight nest on the ground, and lays in it seven to nine or ten eggs, of a somewhat less warm ground-shade than those last named, but with larger and brighter-coloured spots and blotches. \\u2014 Firj. 4:,plale VI. 154. RED d'KOV^'E\\u2014iLagopns Scoticus.) Red Ptarmigan, Red Game, Moor Game, Muir-fowl, Moorbird. \\u2014 A beautiful bird indeed, and pecuhar to the British Islands. The Grouse moors, however, are mainly confined to the nortliern counties of Eugland and Scotland. In the district in which this is written the Grouse may be truly said to abound, and I iiear them coutinually from my garden or open window.* These birds do pair, and pair very early indeed moreover. I have frequently seen them in pairs before the season for killing them, which expires on December 10, is fully out. If the weather becomes severe this union often seems to be annulled ; but I don't think it is in reality. In tlic earlier spring, when the pairing is becoming general, many fierce battles among the males may be seen going on, and very resolute and lengthened and circuitous flights of one in pursuit of another occur. The nest is very slight, of ling and bents chiefly, and usually well concealed in a tuft of heather. From six or seven up to twelve or fifteen eggs are said to be laid, but I should say that the highest average, judging from the number of young bu-ds in a brood, very rarely * For a detailud series of observations on the liahits, &c., of the Grouse, see \\\" Sketches in Natural Uistory,\\\" Routled^e & Co. COSlMON PARTRIDGE. 109 much exceeds eiglat or nine. The eggs are very beautiful and richly coloured, but vary exceedingly in both ground-colour and markings, even those found in the same nest. Some are of a yellowish shade, and others of a blood-stain red, mottled and blotched with rich umber brown, and the paler ones with shades of light-brown. \\u2014 FIq. 5, plate VI. 155. VTKKMlGK^\\u2014iLarjopus vulgaris). White Grouse, Rock Grouse, White Game \\u2014 Only found now among the rocky tops of the highest lulls and mountains in the centre and north of Scotland. It is the smallest species of Grouse in Britain, and its plumage varies greatly with the season, becoming nearly pure white in winter. It lays seven to ten eggs frequently on the bare stones. They are of a yellowish groundcolour, blotched and spotted (slightly so as compared with the eggs of the Red Grouse) with ricli dark bro\\\\vn. 156. COMMON PARTRIDGE\\u2014 (Per(//2- chierea). Much too familiar a bird by appearance, voice and flavour to require any very lengthened notice from us. The Partridge pairs pretty early \\u2014 by the end of January, often \\u2014 and once paired they never separate again throughout the season. At pairing time the cocks fight fiercely, and I have sometimes seen, and even m my garden here, three or four engaged in the conflict, with another, probably the female \\\" apple of discord,\\\" sitting quietly by the while. I have seen the male, too, in the evening, when summoning Ms newly-married wife, stand on the top of one of our stone walls and call repeatedly. The nest is made on the ground in a field of grass or corn, or on a dry hedge bank, or at the foot of a waU among the long grass, and consists of little but a slight depression in the ground, with a few dead leaves and 110 BRITISH BIRDS, THEIR EGGS AND NESTS, twenty. But it is no uncommon thing for two Partridges to laj in the same nest, and an instance came to my knowledge two oi three years since, in which a Ked-legged Partridge had laid several eggs in a Common Partridge's nest. Wlien two birds lay together thus, the covey sometimes amounts to thirty or tliirty-five birds. I knew one instance of forty, about three years since. The male Partridge is known to help his mate, when the hatch is drawing on, by sitting at her side and covering some of the eggs. \\\"VVlien there are two layings in the same nest, it is an interesting question whether the two hens sit together, or the original owner of the nest is simply assisted by her mate. The young bu'ds are able to run and \\\" fend for themselves\\\" almost as soon as they are hatched. The eggs are of a uniform pale oUvebrown hue. \\u2014 Fig. 6, plate VI. 157. RED-LEGGED PARTRIDGE\\u2014 (P^r^j> rufa). French Partridge, Guernsey Partridge. \\u2014 A much more striking bird in appearance than the Common Partridge, and said also to be a powerful enemy to it. Certainly, in districts where it has been encouraged and preserved, it seems to have prevailed to the comparative exclusion of the indigenous species. It is supposed to have been first introduced about the time of Charles II. For long it seems to have increased and spread but very slowly, but now there are many districts of the south where it is exceedingly abundant. These birds form a slight nest of dry bents and leaves upon the ground, amid some growing crop of grass or com. Instances, however, have been asserted in which the nest was a good deal elevated above the ground, as on the top of a stack. The eggs, very hard-shelled, are from ten to fifteen or sixteen in number, of a cream colour, well spotted with small speckles of reddish or cirmamon bro^vn. \\u2014 Fij. 7, plate VI. GREAT BUSTARD. Ill 158. QUAIL \\u2014 {Coturnix vulgaris). The quail is believed, in some rare instances, to stay with us all the year, but is usually only a summer visitant, not coming in any great numbers. In some countries its migratory hosts are so great that one hundred thousand are said to have been taken in a day. In its appearance, the quail strongly reminds one of the Partridge, and suggests the idea that itself is only a diminutive bird of that species. They do not, however, pair, and tlieir nests are met with in many parts of the kingdom. Two years since it was believed that at least two broods were reared on certain lauds in Moorsholm, in North Yorkshire. A small depression in the ground is made, or found, and loosely lined with bits of grass and dry stalks. Seven to ten, or possibly yet more eggs, are laid, presenting much variety of appearance, but usually of a faint cream-coloured ground, mottled and clouded in some cases with red brown, and in others spotted with dark brown spots, some of considerable size. \\u2014 Fig. 8, 'plate VI, IV.\\u2014 STRUTHIONID^. 159. GREAT BUSTARD\\u2014 (O/w larda). Tills noble bird, once abundant enough on our wide plains and wolds in England, is now, I fear, ahnost extinct among us, as so far as I am aware no very recent* capture of it has been announced. It used, before the gun became so common and sc; fatal to birds of much interest to the ornithologist or others, to be customarily pursued with greyhounds. These birds do not pair, and their nest is said to be a mere natural saucer-shapej' hole in the bare ground. The eggs are seldom more than two, or at most three, in number, and are of an oUve-green ground, \\u2022 Since this was written, one instance has occurred. 112 BRITISH BIRDS, THEIR EGGS AND NESTS. blotched aud spotted with two or three snades of brown, lighter and darker.

Stone Cm-lew, Norfolk Plover, \\\"VVliistling Plover, Stone Plover, Thick -knee. \\u2014 The Stone Curlew is a summer visitor, and strictly a local one. The Is ightingale, for instance, is very much more extensively diffused than the bird just named. It is fouud abundantly enough on the wide sandy plains of Norfolk, and 1 used to hear it very commonly in the fields a few miles to the north-west of Bury St. Edmunds. Besides the counties just named, it is met with in parts of Essex and Kent, in Hampshire, and Cambridgeshire, and two or three others. Its peculiar shrill CTj- or whistle, once heard, is not likely to be forgotten. The female lays two eggs on the bare ground, among white-coated flints and stones. An idea of their ground-colour may be given by the mention of what the painters call stone-coloui-, in pale shades, and this is streaked and spotted, or marbled, with dark brown. \\u2014 Fig. 1, plate VII. 182.* PRATINCOLE\\u2014 (G'/roro/a torqmla).

Mr. Yarrell (in whose first edition it appears at the iiead of the Rail-family) says \\u2014 \\\" The Pratincole has been arranged by some authors with the Swallows, by tthcin near the Rails ; but I believe, with ]\\u00bbIr. Selby, that it ought to be included in the family of the Plovers ; and had I kno\\\\\\\\Ti itr. Plover-liie habits and eggs sooner, I should have arranged it between Cursorius and Charadrius.\\\" To this Mr. Hewitson adds \\u2014 \\\" Besides the similarity of then- habits, the fact of this species laying four eggs is a further link to connect it with the Charadi-iidse.\\\" It is, liowever, much too rare \\u2014 besides being known not to breed in Britain \\u2014 to have any claim on our limited space for description of its nest or eggs. 163. GOLDEN ^LOTER\\u2014{Ckaradnus pluvialis). Yellow Plover, Green Plover, Wliistliug Plover. \\u2014 It has sometimes been an object to me to obtain specimens of this bird in its breeding-plumage, and it is scarcely possible to imagine a stronger contrast tlian that presented by the male in lils May di'ess and six or eight months later. All the glossy black of neck and breast has entirely disappeared long before the latter period. I have occasionally seen a single pair or two, very early in the year, separating themselves from the great flock of some scores ; and in the female of one such pair which I shot some few years since (the next shot killing five out of a very large flock at no great distance), I found an egg quite ready for extrusion, and which from the depth of its colourhig, would probably have been laid in the course of a few hours at most. The hen-bird makes a very slight nest, and lays just four eggs in it, seldom either more or less. They are of a large size for the bird, of a fair stone-colour, well blotched and spotted with very dark or blackish brown. After sitting eight or ten days the bird becomes very reluctant to leave her nest, and will suffer herself to be almost I 114 BRITISH BIRDS, THEIR EGGS AND NESTS. trodden on rather. The young ones, awkward-looking motlied yellow and brown puff-balls on stilts, run fast and well soon after they are batched, and do not speedily acquire the use of those \\u25a0wings which, after a time, are to be so strong and swift. Very jeaioas too, are the parents as long as their young are only runners, and very plaintive is their incessant piping if you or your dog approach too near their place of concealment. \\u2014 \\u00a5ig. 2, plate VII. 164. DOTT'E.ViEL\\u2014iCharadnus mormellus). Dottrel or Dotterel Plover, Foolish Dottrel. \\u2014 This is a summer visitor to our country, and in many localities where it used to be abundant, or at least common, it is now rare or almost unknown. This is the case on parts at least of the Yorkshire Wolds, as well as in the Lake district. They are sought after by the Fly-fisher and by the Ornithologist and by the Epicure, and from their exceedingly simple and unsuspicious habits they fall easy victims before the fowlhig-piece of modern days. The female makes no nest, but lays her customary three eggs in a slight cavity on the ground near high mountain tops, where some tall-growing moss or other mountain herbage facilitates concealment. The eggs are of an olivaceous hue, spotted plentifully with very dark brown or brownish-blacK. 165. RINGED PLOVER\\u2014 (C/^^ra^/rzz^s Uuticula). Ringed or Ring Dottrel. \\u2014 A very pretty shore-bird, of interesting habits, and not infrequent, especially in winter, on many parts of the British coast. In quiet parts, whore large expanses of sand or shingle, or even mud, are left by the receding tide, it may be seen in numbers. It seems to make no nest : \\u2014 the eggs are laid on the sand, and often at a very considerable distance from the sea ; as, for instance, on the warrens in Norfolk and Suffolk, They are four in number, very large in proportion to 115 the s:z3 of the bird, possessing the 2;cculiar pointcLl shape of tlie eggs of the entire class of birds we are now among, and of a warm cream-colour, spotted and streaked with black. The parent birds try hard to lead the casual intruder away from the vicinity of their young. \\u2014 Jig. 3, plate VII. IGG. KENTISH PLOVER\\u2014 (a^/r\\u00abf/r/\\u00ab.? Cmdianus). Seldom obtained vei-y far from the southern coasts of England, and not appearing to be a very plentiful bird e\\\\'en there. In liabits, it strongly resembles the Ring Plover just named. The female makes no nest, but lays her four eggs in a slight hollow on sand or shingle, which strongly resemble some of the lightercoloured examples of the eggs of the last-named species. \\u2014 Fig. 4, plate VII. 1G7. LITTLE RINGED V\\\\jO^^YK\\u2014{Charadrius minor). A very rare British Bird. 16S. GREY VLOTEK\\u2014iSquatarola cinerea). A bird which has never been ascertained to breed in England, although specimens in the dark-breasted ]\\\\Iay plumage have been seen in the London Markets, and observed by Mr. Selby in the Fame Islands, in June. It is not uncommon as a winter visitor, lliough even then nothing like so numerous as the Golden Plover in its winter visits to districts in which it does not breed. The eggs are said to be in colour \\\" oil green, spotted with different shades of umber brown ; the spots, crowded and confluent round the obtuse end.\\\" 16D. LAP'vVING \\u2014 iVanellua cmtaius). ' I'ewit or Peewit, Te-wit, Teu-fit, Green Piover, Bastard Plover, Green Lapwing, Crested Lapwing. \\u2014 Anotiier of thosa bircib whiuh are familiar to almost everyone who is not a mere casual visitor to the country, or quite deaf and bUnd to its commonest sounds and sights. It is a very universally diflfused 116 BRITISH BIRDS, TIIEIK EGGS AND NBSTS. bird, even in those districts where it docs not statedly breed. It nests not only on commons and heaths and the wide moor, but in the fields and inclosures; and round my present residence 1 have many yearly evidences that there are half-a-dozen nests within tlie linuts of a sliort lialf-mile wliich intervenes between me and thfc moors. The female constructs scarcely any nest, properly so called, but makes or more likely avails herself of a ready-made slight cavity on the siu'face of the ground, with a sufficiency of some kind of herbage to serve as covert. The female's habits in tonnection with the nest and eggs are different from the male's. She slips off on the approach of a visitor, aud runs very silently and quietly away to some distance before taking wing ; he hastens up on rapid, sounding, whirling wing, and cries and dashes and wheels above and around the cause of alarm in a very remarkable manner. The Peewit lays four eggs, of large size and acutely pointed at the lesser end, and like so many others of the class, often arranged so as to occupy the least possible space, by having their pomts all turned inward. They are of a darkish olive-dun ground, abundantly blotched and spotted with brown and black. These eggs are much sought after as delicacies for the table. They are boiled hard and served cold, and when tlie shell is removed they have quite a jelly-like appearance. But very few of the eggs, however, sold in the market as \\\" Plovers'- eggs,\\\" are sometimes recognised by the oologist as having been laid by tlie Lapv/ing. \\u2014 Tig. 5, jilate VI L 170. TURxN STONE\\u2014 (5/re/j5i7aj tnferpres). Hebridal Sandpiper. \\u2014 Found on many parts of our coast either in small parties, or one or two together, from September aJl through the winter.

It is found associating most commonly, though in small parties for the most part, with the Dunlin, and other similar shorehaunting bii'ds. 172. OYSTER-CATCHER\\u2014 (Zr\\u00ab\\u00aba/o;)\\u00ab5 ostntlegm). Pied Oyster-catcher, Shelder, Sea-Pie, Olive. \\u2014 A very beautiful and well-known dweller on our sea-coasts, and wonderfully provided by nature, too, with a suitable instrument for purveying its destined food. The bill of the Oyster-catcher is one of those natural objects which form each a study in themselves. Woe be to the oyster or mussel, however powerful its mechanism for closing its valves, if once the Oyster-catcher has found means to insert that natural weapon of his. Flattened sideways, and hard and strong as so much bone, its eiEcacy is so great that there can be scarcely a struggle for life on the part of the shell-fish. It runs well, and is even said to dive and swim with facility. I never saw this, though I have had them mider my observation for hours together in fonncr days. But I know their shrill, rattling whistle, and their short uneasy (lights, and restless paddlings up and doMTi upon the ooze, wlien I liave been among their haunts, well \\u2014 and marry a nest it used to be my lot to discover on some parts of some of the Essex Saltings.

III.\\u2014 ARDEID^. 174. COMMON W^VSm\\u2014{Ardea cinerea). Hern, Heronshaw, Heronseugh. \\u2014 It would have been no light matter once to have molested a Heron. Those birds were \\\" preserved\\\" with a strictness we scarcely can imagine even in these days of game-preserves. They were the peculiar game of royal and noble personages. Now, however, the case is widely different, and probably not one Heron in a himdred can now be met with as compared with the days of falconry. It is a strange odd sight to sec a Heron balancing himself on the topmost twig of some fir-tree, and succeeding after a few uneasy motions of body and wings in poising himself. The Heron sometimes breeds on precipitous rocks, but much more commonly on trees, \\u2014 generally trees of large size, and commonly oaks or firs. It is not a solitary builder, but Kke the Hook forms a community, and frequents the same tree or clump of trees tlircugh successive years for many generations. Each nest is of large size, and composed of sticks with a lining of wool. Four or five eggs are usually deposited, of an uniform pale green colour. A few nests ai-e said to hare been met with on the ground. \\u2014 Fiq. 1, ylate VIII. LITTLE BITTEKN. 175. PURPLE KERO'^\\u2014iJrdea purpurea).

Sometimes smgly and sometimes in groups of eight or ten, it may be seen along the line of oozy shores or the sandy Qats which are laid bare by the receding tide. When the water is sufficiently high to cover all its feeding grounds, it betakes itself to some higher groiuid in the vicinity, to rest during those hours of inactivity in food-search. When removing from one place, or part of the coast, to another, it usually flics in long lines, which liowevcr scarcely maintain the same degree of accuracy as in the case of Wild Geese or other line-flying wild fowl. On the arrival of spring the Curlews leave the coast and retire to their breeding niunts iu the hills of the extreme north of England, the highest 15i2 BIUTISI! liiRL'S, TUEIK liGCiS AND NESTS. moorlands of Scotland, and other similar places in more norther!^ latitudes yet. Its note once heard is sufficiently noticeable to be easily recognised on any future occasion. It makes a very careless or rude nest, and lays four eggs which vary a good deal in the depth of the ground-colour and the amount of their spots. It is pale greenish dun, varying to olive-green, and spotted with darker shades of green and dark-brown. \\u2014 Fig. 3, jilate VIII. 190. ^\\\\lllls^>>\\\\l'EL\\u2014{Numenius phceopus).

It is seen, in no great numbers, on many of our coasts in winter ; nut I have met with it on the Essex Saltings only in the early spring and previous to its retirement to the north to breed. It is difficult to assert positively that it frequents any part of the main British Island for that purpose ; but it is known to nest in both Orkney and Shetland. The nest is said by Dr. Fleming to be placed in exposed parts of a moor. The eggs are four in number, and, though very much less in size very much like the darker varieties of the Curlew's eggs.

Many ''>ng days have I spent amid their haunts on the Essex Saltings. Their nests are very slightly constructed of a few bits of grass amidst a tuft of herbage, or in a small hole or cavity which is sheltered by some cf the taller-growing marine plants. The eggs are usually :'our in number, occasionally but two or three, of a cream-colcur (sometimes daslicd with a somewhat warmer hue) spotted and speckled with dark brown. The spots are less and more numerous than in the case of the Peewit's egg. Tn the case of the last nest I foimd, about two years since, the old bird suffered me to walk within a yard of her before taking flight. \\\"WTien the young are newly hatched the parent birds betray excessive jealousy and anxiety at the approach of either man or dog to their resort. They liave sometimes come and settled on the ground within two or three paces of mc, and, at others, flown so directly towards me, as to suggest tlie possible intention of attacking mc, piping most plaintively and incessantly tlie wliile. This conduct is designated by the term \\\" mobbing,\\\" on the Essex marshes. Fi^. 4, plale VIII. ]93. GREEN ^\\\\lsT)-V\\\\Vn{.\\u2014{Tof anus och opus). It is supposed that a few of these birds may remain with us to breed ; but far the greater part of those which are customarily seen about the sides of our smaller streams and ditches and canals, are kno^vn to retui-n far to the north to produce their eggs and young. I believe no authenticated instances of its nesting with us are known, but a few very young birds have been met with under circumstances which seemed to leave no doubt that tliey must have been hatched in the neighbourhood.

It is not by any means a frequently occurring visitor, though it seems to be admitted that it is more than probable it sometimes breeds in this country. Mr. Hoy's account of its habits and nesting peculiarities, as observed by himself in Dutch Brabant, is quoted at length by both Mr. Yarrell and Mr. Ilewitson. He says, \\\" The nest is generally placed at a short distance from the water, among stunted heath, or scrubby plants of the Bog Myrtle, or among coarse grass and rushes. It is placed in. a hollow, and formed of dry grass and other plants. The eggs^ are four iia number.\\\" \\\" They are pointed in shape, of a pale greenish white, spotted and speckled, particularly over the broad end, with dark reddish brown,\\\" 195.

Unlike the Dipper, wliich may constantly be seen sitting quite still near the edge of the stream, the Summer Snipe is always in motion. It makes a very rude nest of dry grass in some hole in a bank not far from water, where the shelter anil concealment of sufhcient herbage is available, and lays in it four eggs, which vary often in colour and spots but are usually of a ytUowish-white, with blotches and spots of deep brown or ordinary brown.

It is only rare as a species, and not known positively to breed anywhere much south of the Hebrides. The nest is said to be like that of the Golden Plover or Lapwing, consisting only of a few blades of grass or sprigs of ling, placed in a hollow in the soil. The eggs\\u2014 like so very many of those characterised by the pyriform shape peculiar to the Grallatores \\u2014 are placed with their pointed ends together in the middle, and are of a pale yellowish-green colour, spotted all over irregularly with dark brown with intermingled blotches of light pui-plish-grey ; the spots and blotches being more nuinerous at the larger end. 198.

But our forefathers tliought many things of the eatable sort good, which their descendants of ISGl had rather not sit down to. I rather tliink my young readers might not eat Poi-poise or Heron either, with any great relish, not to speak of other matter* about equally, or more questionably, \\\" good eating.\\\" Both this species of Godwit and the one to be mentioned next are subject, like the Golden Plover, the Gray Plover, the Spotted Redshank, aad many others yet to be named, to very great and striking changes of plumage in the breeding season. At all times they are handsome birds. Tiie Black-Tailed Godwit is believed stUl to breed, however rarely, in England \\u2014 in Norfolk and Cambridgeshire, in fact. The nest Is found in marshy places, made of dry grass and the like, and more or less concealed by the coarse i,'rowths peculiar to such places. The eggs vary in both size a:i.^. colours, but are usually of a greenish oiive-browTi, marbled and KUFF. 127 blotched with darker brown ; and, as usual in this class of birds, are generally four in iiuinber. 201.

Now, I fear, be woidd scarcely get that number in an entire season. The Ruff is, however, stiU. known to breed annually in some of the fens of Lincolnshire and Cambridgeshire. The variety of plumage, no less than the very remarkable ruff or feathery appendage about the neck of the male in the breeding season, is quite sufficient to make this a very conspicuous bird among our truly native birds. Scarcely any two males in an assemblage of some dozens can, in some cases, be picked out as possessing exactly the same plumage. The breeding habits, or some of them, observed in this bird are also very characteristic. His Latin name, as given above, simply meats \\\"pugnacious warrior,\\\" and verily he is as thorough a lover of battle as any knight-errant of the middle ages, or fierce Northern sea-rover of four or five centuries earlier. They do not pair, and therefore fight for the possessioji of the females, and they have spots, known to the fenmen by the name of Hills, which are as much the scenes of universal challenge and battle as ever the stated \\\"lists\\\" of the old days of tournament or playing at battle.

The Reeves lay each her four eggs, which vary in colour from olive-green to a yellowish stone colour, and are spotted and blotched with \\\"liver colour\\\" and rich brown. 203. WOOD-COCK\\u2014 {Scolopax rudicola). One of our most universally recognised \\\"birds of passage,\\\" coming to us sometimes in the autumn (always, at least, beginning to arrive in October), and leaving us again in the spring ; still no season passes, there is reason to believe, in which many pairs do not remain to breed, and that too in many different parts of the kingdom. It was an object to me some twenty years ago to obtain eggs of the Woodcock, and I applied to a person in Norfolk, who had not any difficulty in procuring for me eggs from the gamekeeper of a neighboui'ing estate out o( two different nests which had been deserted by their owners. My friend added the information, that scarcely a year passed in which one nest or more of Woodcocks was not known of on the estate in question. The nest, a very loose one, is made of deaa leaves and the like. Bracken leaves appearing to be commonly used for the purpose. The eggs are usually about four in number, and want the peculiar pointed shape common to almost all the other birds of the Order. They are of a dirty yellowishwhite, a good deal blotched and spotted with two or three shades of pale brown and purplish-grey. The old bird is known to transport her young, if occasion demands, from one place to another. She has been seen doing so repeatedly, and by good observers, generally making use of both feet for the purpose, sometimes one only ; and, it is said, using her beak sometimes foi the same purpose. \\u2014 Fig. 1, plate IX. <;OM.MON SNll'E. 121 20i.

Solitary Snipe, Double Suipe. \\u2014 Often taken, no doubt, by many a sportsman in former days to be a very large specimen o the Common Snipe, than which no bird with wliieh I am well acquainted seems to vary more in si;5C. On the wing it does not look much larger than the Common Snipe, and is seldom seen except alone, or at most two in company. It breeds in higli northern localities, and never with us, and no notice, therefore, of its nesting habits is permissible in this place. 205. COMMON SmVE\\u2014iScolopax ffallimf/o). Whole Snipe, Snite, Heather-bleatcr. \\u2014 Although this Snipe, like the Woodcock, retires to northern latitudes to breed, yet there are few districts in Britain suitable to its habits in wliich it is not known to breed in greater or less numbers. And it is a bird, moreover, which is quite sure to make it very distinctly known that it has a nest and eggs somewhere near, if only any human visitor appears on the scene. I refer to the very peculiar note or sound emitted Ijy the male, always while he is on the wing high in the air, and always accompanied with a very remarkable action of his wings and curving descent iu his flight. This sound or note \\u2014 for it is not absolutely certain, I think, how it is produced \\u2014 is variously called humming, bleating, drumming, buzzing. To me, the first time I heard it, and before I knew to wnat origin to assign it, the impression produced was precisely that of a large Bee, entangled in some particular place and unable to extricate itself ; and I remem.ber spending some minutes in trying to discover the supposed insect. The eggs are usually four, placed in a very sh'ght and inartificial nest on the ground near some tuft of rushes or other water-herbage. They are of a greenish-olive hue, blotched and spotted with two or three shades of brown, the deepest being very dark. The old ones are said to K 139 BRITISH BIRDS, THEIR EGGS AND NKSTS. be very jealous and careful of their young.

D unlin Sandpiper, PuiTC, Churr, Stint, Oxbird, Sea Snipe, Least Snipe, Sea Lark. \\u2014 Perhaps the very commonest and best known, as well as incomparably the most abundant of all our small shore bii'ds, and yet the one about which heaps of scientific mistakes have been made. The male has a conspicuous weddingdress, which he duly puts on in the Spring, and once it was on R 2 132 BlllTISII BIKDS, THEIR EGGS AND KESTS. he was ciiristened Tringa Alpina, tlie DuiJin. Then in the autiunn and winter, having divested himself alike of his summer dress and alJ properly or concern in wife and children, he wa? named anew Tringa Cinclus, the Purre. On its behig satisfactorily ascertained that the only real difference between Dunlin and Purre was that of a few feathers, and those cliiefly on the breast, and dependent simply on Season, the new name at the head of this notice was suggested and willingly adopted as altogettier a fit one. The Dunlin, always called Oxbird where my boyhood was spent, and often seen there in flocks of not simply hundi'cds, but thousands, and many thousands, in the autumn and winter, goes to the far north to breed, though some of their hosts stay in the north of Scotland, the Hebrides, Orkneys and other Islands near. Their nests are placed on the ground, among long grass and ling, and always contain four eggs. Mr. Hewitson says : \\u2014 \\\" In beauty of colouring and elegance of form the eggs of the Dunlin are unrivalled. The groundcolour is sometimes of a clear light green, richly spotted with, light brown ; sometimes the ground-colour is of a bluish-white.\\\"' The hen will suffer herseK to be removed from her nest by the naud rather than leave her eggs. \\u2014 Ylg. 3, plate IX. 217.

LAND-RAIL\\u2014 (Ci-e.r pratensis). Corn Crake, Meadow Crake, Dakerhen. \\u2014 This bird is found in most parts of tlie kingdom, though for the most part in no great abundance any where, in the earlier months of the autumn. In most of the northern parts it breeds annually, but I clo not remember ever hearmg its breeding note while I was a dweller in the district embracing what are usually called the Eastern Counties. Nor yet in Herefordshire. But the note in question has been sufficiently familiar to me for the last twenty years, and here in North Yorkshire I hear it on all sides of me, at all hours, I may say, of day and night. For two or three years in succession a pair took possession of a small plantation of young fir trees bordering my garden lawn on the north, and only separated from it by a deep ditch with a run of water at the bottom. Long after the union seemed to have been formed the pecidiar note was kept up, and I used to see both birds within a few feet of each other during its continuance. Scarcely a day passed during their sojourn of eight or ten days in and about the plantation, but excursions were taken into the garden, frequently extending to the terrace beneath my dining-room window, where sundry very inquirnig and mterested glances \\u2014 not to say stares \\u2014 were exchanged between the visitors and myself and divers members of my family. The visitors seemed very little disturbed at our notice as long as we remained quite still and silent, but any movement on our part led to immediate retreat on the Corn Crake's. Its movements were desultory or in jerks, so to Bpeak. The bird would run ten or twelve paces in an attitude and with a speed which left one in doubt for a moment whether it were not some small quadruped. Tiien it would 134 BRITISH BIRDS, TUEIR EGGS AND >'ESTS, skulk amid taller herbage, or under tlie slirubs of a raised bed, m beneath a rhododendron bush. A minute after it would be seea with its head and whole body erect, and the neck so out-stretched that if the bird had been hung up by its head it could not have been much more elongated. This was the invariable position or attitude assumed when interchanging looks with tlie occupants of the window. My own impression was that these journeys or excui-sions (which I knew extended into the grass-Held beyond the garden, and into a field over the road at the back of tlie plantation) were simply made for the purpose of inspection, and with a view to the selection of a place for nesting \\u2014 and tliat, pending this interesting investigation, the fir trees and herbage baucatli afforded an ample covert. As far as I could ascertain, the place actually selected by them for the purpose was in the field \\u2014 a corn-field \\u2014 just beyond that which lay adjacent to the garden. The Corn Crake makes a loose nest of dry herbage and stalks and grass ; and I think almost always among growing herbage \\u2014 grass, clover, or corn. The hen lays seven or eight eggs, sometimes even ten, and sits very close upon them. They are whitish in ground, suffused with a reddish tinge, and spotted and speckled with brownish-red and purplish-grey . \\u2014 Fig. 4, phi{e IX. 219. SrOTTED CRk'K'E\\u2014{Crex j^orzana). A summer visitor, as the Land Rail is, to our shores. It is rare, however, compared with the Land Rail, and with more predilection for the vicinity of water. Like all tlie other Rails it conceals itself very closely, and from the form of its body and power of leg runs with great speed and equal facility, even among what seems to be and is very thick covert. It is knowai to breed m Norfolk and in Cambridgeshire, and is believed to do 40 in other localities as well. The nest, made on the ground i\\u00bb WATEK-RAIL. 105 wet marshes, is \\\"formed on the outside,\\\" says Mr. Yarrell, \\\" with coarse aquatic plants, lined witii finer materials within.\\\" From seven to ten eggs appears to be the number laid, and they vary very much in their ground-colour, between a pale brownishdun and a slightly yellow-white, the spots or blotches being of a reddish brown of some intensity. \\u2014 Fig. 5, plate IX. 220.

I have seen it at a 1 seasons of the year, though it is, I am weU aware, less tolerant of cold than many other of our winter-stay mg birds. Its motions on the bank of a stream, when suddenly disturbed, are much more like those of a Water Rat than a bird. It breeds with some degree of commonness in several of the Southern counties. I obtained two nests from the estate in Norfolk, already mentioned in these pages, at the same time with the Woodcock's eggs, and was informed that it bred regularly there. I had reason also to know that it bred at ToUeshunt D'Arcv, in Essex. The nest is made often in an osier ground or among thick water plants, and composed of different kinds of aquatic herbage. The eggs are from six to nine or ten in number, and seldom quite white mhue; usually they are much more like pale or faded specimens of the Land Rail's eggs, the spots being both fewer and fainter. \\u2014 Fig. ht plate IX, J36 BITISU BUIDS, THElll EGGS A.NH KtSlS. 223. MOOR ilES\\u2014{Gallinula cJiloropus). Water Hen, Gallinule, Moat Hen, Marsh Hen.\\u2014 Few nesthiuaters, liowcver young, hut know the nest and eggs of this very common bird. I have in many cases seen it almost domesticated, and constantly taking its food among domestic fowls, and sometimes even almost from the hands of human creatm-es. Its nest is made in somewhat various places. I have seen it amid the sedges growing in the water near the edge of a marsh-ditch or the like, on di-y tussocky tumps near a sheet of water, among ^he herbage and wiUow stubs not far from the same Mere, built upon masses of fallen but not decayed buh-ushes and flags, at the edge of a pond, on a bough projecting several feet horizontally from the bank over and resting upon (or partly in) the water of a running stream, nay, even in a branch or top of a thick tree, or among the ivy which mantled its trunk and wreathed its branches. In it are laid six, seven, or eight eggs, of a reddish-white colour, sparingly speckled and spotted with reddish-brown. The eggs have been known to be removed by the parent birds under circumstances of perd awaiting them \\u2014 from a flood for instance \\u2014 and hatched in some new locality. Instances also have been recorded in which a supplementary nest has been constructed by the female parent to receive a part of her brood, when they were too numeious mid had grown too large to be accommodated by their original nest-home at night. \\u2014 Fiff. 7, plate IX. VI.\\u2014 LOBIPEDIDvE. 224.\\u2014 COOT\\u2014 (i^\\u00ab//f\\u00ab atra). Bald Coot.\\u2014 A common bird enough in many parts of tne kingdom, and, in former days, I have sometunes seen them in straggling flocks of several hundreds or tliousands along the tide- way GKEr-LKGGED GOOSE, 1^7 on the Essex coasts. Witli its white oval spot ou the forehead, and perfectly black plumage, it is a suillcieatly noticeable bird. It seems to be much more at home on the water than on land ; but, like the Moor lien, can and does move with very considerable ease and speed on the latter. The Coot makes a large and very strong and compact nest, makmg or finding a Gxm foundation for it below the surface of tlie water, and heaping up and twisting in dry flags and bukushes and pieces of reed, until some of the nests are sufEcicntly firm and stable to support a considerable weight. The eggs laid are usually seven or eight, and up to ten; though even twelve or fourteen have been mentioned as sometimes found. They are of a dingy stone-colour, speckled and spotted with dark brown. \\u2014 Fi^. 8, p/aie IX. 225. GREY PHALAROPE\\u2014 (P//\\u00ab/\\u00abro;??\\u00ab loba(us). Red Phalarope. \\u2014 Supposed, some half-century since, to be exceedingly rare in this country, but now known to visit our shores in small numbers, perliaps annually, on their way to their winter place of sojourning. Like the Coot, they arc lobe-footed, and very capable swimmers. 226. RED-NECKED niMjrVllO^'E.\\u2014iF/iaiaropus hijpsrhoreus). Red Piialarope. \\u2014 More rare than the last-named in England, though occun-ing, occasionally, somewhat more abundantly in some of tlie northern Scotch Islands. v.\\u2014 NATATORES. FAMILY I.\\u2014 ANATIDtS. 227. GREY-LEGGED GOOSE\\u2014 (J;^?er/er\\u00abj). Grey-lag Goose, Grey Goose, Wild Goose. \\u2014 It is not proposed to give any illustrations whatever of the eggs of the Wildfowl \\u2014 the Geese, Swans, Ducks, ar.d Divmg Ducks \\u2014 inasmuch as they are not only of large size, and would usurp much space 138 BHITISU BIRDS, THEIR EGGS AND NESTS. to the absolute exclusion of many others of much interest and urgently demanding pictorial illustration, but, also, are characterised by so much sameness or general uniformity of colour ; \\u2014 for they vary only, in that respect, about as much as the eggs of the common Fowl and common Duck do. A very large proportion of them, moreover, never by any chance breed in any portion of the British Islands, but resort to distant and very northerly localities for that purpose. The first on our list, the Common Grey, or Wild Goose, is an instance in point. It is believed once to have been a regular inhabitant, and to have bred abundantly in the fenny districts which then prevailed over many parts of the kingdom, not at all near or connected with what is yet called \\\" the fen country.\\\" But now it is comparatively a rare bird at any season of the year, and nests no nearer to us than some of the isles and coasts of Scandinavia. 228. BEAN GOOS^\\u2014(Jnser set/e^/m). Like the last, and in common witli the Geese next to be men* tioned, indiscriminately know^l by the name of Wild Goose. Unlike the last, however, it is ascertained to breed in small numbers on some of the large lakes in the north of Scotland, and iu the islands of Ijf^wis and Harris. Besides which, a nesting locality of this species in Westmoreland is named. The nests, iu some instances, are hid in very tall ling, and the eggs are from five to seven in number. In size they are a little under 3| inches long by 2^ broad. 229. PINK-rOOTED GOOSI.\\u2014(Jnser hrachyrhyncus). A smaller bird than the last, but otherwise bearing a veiy strolls' resemblance to it ; so much so, that it appears more than probable it has often been assumed to be a young or small specimen of the former species. It is, however, of compai'atively raro occurrence notwithstanding. BRENT GOOSE. 1S9 230. WHITE-FRONTED GOOSE\\u2014 (^\\u00ab.?ca alblfrons). Laughing Goose. \\u2014 A regular winter visitor, and not in any very scanty numbers. One of my very worst discomfitures in my early sporting-days took place in connection with a flock of these birds. There were seven or eight of them -which flew deUberately right on towards my fatlier and myself till they were within twentyfive yards of us, and then they doubled up into a confused clump, and I was already counting the slain when my gun missed fire. My father's did not, and gave us the opportunity of identifying the species. It breeds in Scotland and other countries far to the north. 231. BERNICLE GOOSE\\u2014 (^;wer leucopsis). Another winter visitor ; often appearing in great flocks, but always retiring to the north again to breed. It is supposed to frequent the shores of the White Sea especially for such purpose. 232. BRENT GOOSE\\u2014 (4;^.ye/- brcutu). Black Goose, Ware Goose. \\u2014 By far tlie most numerous of all the geese which visit oiir shores in winter, as it is also the least. I have seen it in inconceivable numbers on the Essex coast in hard winters, and the numbers reported to have been killed at one discharge of a heavy ]mnt-gun, seem simply incredible. In the very hard and loug-coutiuued winter of 1S37-3S, I saw the ice which, in broken fragments of four or five feet square by three or four inches thick, covered the whole estuary of the Blackwater at ToUesbury (a space ot very considerable width), black with them during highwater. The expression m.ade use of by one of the sea-faring men of the neighbourhood was, \\\"There are acres of 'em.\\\" StiU of all their vast numbers none remain to breed, and no great proportion of them are known to breed in Europe. 140 BRITISH BIRDS, TUEIR EGGS AND NESTS. 233. KED-BREASTED GOOSE\\u2014 (Jnser rujicollis). A very rare species, and one of which but little is known as to history or habits. 234.. EGYPTIAN GOOSE\\u2014 (^\\u00ab*.-- Egi/piiacus). Equally rare and more exceptional than the last : as the few that have occurred may have escaped from confinement. 235. SPUR-WINGED GOOSE\\u2014 (^\\u00ab5er Gambensis). Gambo Goose. \\u2014 An accidental visitor mdeed. 23G. CANADA GOOSE\\u2014 {Anser Ca)iadeiisis). Cravat Goose. \\u2014 Many of these remarkably fine birds are kept on ornamental waters in many different parts of the kingdom ; and these have been known sometimes (aided by a storm, perhaps. or some unusual occurrence) to make their escape. Many of the supposed wild birds shot, or otherwise taken, have been accounted for on the supposition that they are such escaped birds. However, it would seem most probable that considerable flights of really wild Cravat Geese do occasionally visit this country, and even that some pair or two of them may occasionally stay to breed. The eggs are six. to nine in number, of very large size and white. 237. llOOVEl\\\\\\u2014{C!/ffm(s feria). Wild Swan, Whistling Swan, Elk. \\u2014 Of sufficiently common occurrence on the British coasts, and particularly in hard winters. Few birds vary much more in size and weight than do these. A young bird of the year may weigh only twelve or thirteen pounds ; the older and more full-grown specimens, twenty or twenty-one. They breed very far to the north. 238. BEWICK'S S\\\\Nm\\u2014{Ci/gnus Bewickii). A smaller bird than the Hooper, and of very much rarer occurrence. Still it is an ascertained species, and visits us frequently, not annually, in some numbers. COilMON SUIELDRAKR. 141 239. MUTE SWAIi\\u2014iCyffms oior.) The Common tame Swan of our ornamental waters. \\u2014 They Are found wild in many, if not all, the nortlicrn countries of Europe. It is too well knov\\\\Ti by everyone to require detailed notice here, 240. POLISH SWAN\\u2014 ((%\\u00ab\\u00ab5 immutabilis). A bird of very rare occurrence in a wUd state, and deriving its Latin name from the circumstance that its plumage undergoes no change in colour at any period of its age. It is always wliite. The cygnets of the other swans are, on the contrary, grey or dusky-coloured for a lengthened period, and only become wliite on their reaching maturity. 241. RUDDY SHrELDRAKE\\u2014 (^fl^oraa rutila). A bird of exceedingly rare occurrence. 242. COMMON SHIELDRAKE\\u2014 (r\\u00ab^ora\\u00ab vulpamer). Burrow Duck, Skel Goose, Bar Goose. \\u2014 One of the very most beautiful of aU our wild fowl, or even of those which for their beauty are selected to be ornamental accessions to the waters of the park or pleasm-e-ground. Its plumage is so beautiful and clear and brilliant, and its attitude in repose so graceful, one camiot but admire it greatly. It breeds not uncommonly on many sandy parts of our coasts, occupying the deep rabbit-burrows, which are found in what are called the \\\" sand-hills,\\\" to place its nest in. Tiie nest is one reaUy, made of bents and dry stalks, and lined or cushioned with down liberally plucked from the builder's own breast. The number of eggs laid varies between eight or nine and twelve or fourteen. They are nearly or quite white, about 2f inches long by nearly 2 in breadth. I have known instances in which the eggs obtained from one of tlicir nests have been hatched under a common Hen. The young seemed to accustom themselves to their life of restraint tolerably 143 liUlTISII BllltS, rUEIR ECGS AND NESTS. well, out never showed any disposition to pair or breed. Fro. bably it might be because no suitable hole for a nest was withm their reach. The male of this species is known to assist the female in the labours and constraint of incubation. 243. SHOVELLER\\u2014 (^\\u00abas clypeatd). Elue-wiiiged Shoveller, Broad bill. \\u2014 The first ia the list of the true Ducks, and a very beautifully plumaged bird indeed. But gaily feathered as he is, and brilliant as is a part, at least, of the plumage of all the male Ducks during a certain portion of the year, yet it is remarkable that they all undergo a change in this respect about the breeding time, just the reverse of that which takes place in the males of so many other birds at the same season. They become more brilliant, or their colours deeper or richer then: \\u2014 the male ducks duskier, plainer coloui-ed, more like the female in her more unobtrusive hues. The Shoveller's biU is very remarkable, and, as I said of the Oyster-catcher's, a study for all who admu-e the works of God. It merits our notice for its adaptation to its purposes in a direction just opposite to that which characterizes the bill of the bird just named. Dilated at the sides so as almost to look awkward, it is furnished with a large series of very sensitive laminae or plates, such that the minute objects which form a considerable portion of the bird's food may be instantly detected by the sense of touch, and retamed. It used to breed very commonly in many parts of the kingdom, Norfolk and tlie Een districts for instance, as well as in. Homney Marsh and other places more in the south of the Island. At present it has become comparatively rare. The nest is made ol fine grass, and the eggs are eventually enveloped in down procured from the bird's o\\\\vn breast. The eggs may be from eight to twelve in number, white, tinged with a greenish-dun shade, and about 2 inches long by \\\\\\\\ broad. WILD r^LTK. 1*3 244. GADWALL\\u2014 (.//i\\u00ab5 sCreperu). Hodge, Grey Duck. \\u2014 A Duck which occurs L\\\\ no very great Ctimbers at any time ; mostly about the end of the -whiter, or in spring; and is not known to breed commonly in any part of ilorope. 2i5. PINTAIL BVGK\\u2014iAnas acuta) Cracker, \\\"Winter Duck. \\u2014 An early visitor to our sliores wliea winter has once urged the wild fowl hosts to leave their nortliern nesting-places. It is not, however, a numerous bird with us, but abounds in many of the northernmost countries of Europe. 246. BIMACULATED Ti\\\\]CYi\\u2014{AnasgIocitans). Hather a handsome bird in plumage and markings, but one of rare occurrence, and of which or its liabits very little is known. 247. WILD DUCK\\u2014 (^ms boschas). MaUard. \\u2014 By far the most common of all our wild fowl among the Ducks, but lessening, year by year, in the numbers which visit us. Within my own recollection many Decoys on the Essex coast were wrought constantly and successfully, which for many years now have been dismantled and unused. I well remember, when I was a lad of ten or twelve, being at a house in Tolleshunt D'Arcy, on the farm belonging to which was an active Decoy, and seeing the birds whicli had been taken in the course of one morning. Tlie numbers were so great tluit many of the undermost Ducks, where the great accumulation had taken place at the end of the \\\" pipe,\\\" bad died of pressure and suffocation, and some even were sensibly flattened by the superincumbent weight of their fellows. The multiplication of shooters on shore and afloat has sensibly tended to lessen the numbers of the Wild Duck ; while di-ainage on a large scale in many a district the country through, has materially lessened the number of their haunts. Still a very considerable number remain to breed, and 144 BlUTISU BIRDS, TllEIK EGGS AND NKSTB. a Wild Duck's nest in many parts of the kingdom is no raritj. The nest is made of grass, lined and interwoven -with down. It is customarily placed on dry ground on the margin of water, among reeds and bulrushes, or the like ; but may often be found at sorae distance from water, and in places so unlikely for the purpose as on tlie open moor, or in a tree top, or in tlie lofty deserted nest of a crow. The eggs are from nine to twelve in number, sometimes however exceeding the latter limit, of a ;\\u00bbreeuish-white colour, and about 2 j inches long by 1 1 broad. It is long before the young Wild Ducks fly well enough to leave their native reed beds, or similar shelter, and, in the state preceding that of actual power to fly away, they are called Flappers; and many a Flapper hunt have I taken part in in my youngei days. 248. GARGANEY\\u2014 (y/\\u00ab\\u00abi querquedidd). Summer Duck, Summer Teal, Pied Wiggon. \\u2014 This is a somewhat rare bird, and is seen sometimes in late autumn, but more usually in the spring. It has been known to breed in this country, though by no means commonly or frequently. It is said to make a nest among reeds of dry grass, rushes and down, and the number of eggs deposited to run from eight or nine tc twelve, or even more. They are of a disiiuct but pale bufT colour. If inch long by l^- broad. 249. TEAL \\u2014 {Anas crecca). A very pretty little Duck, and the least of all our wLite? visiters of that species. It is of common occurrence, but not met with in any great numbers. It breeds abundantly in Norway and Sweden, and especially in Lapland, whither the great oulk of our winter friends retire on the approach of the northern summer ; stiU, pairs often remain throughout the summer in various parts of oui- country to nest and rear their young. EIDER DUCK, 14? WTieu 1 was a boy 1 heard of nests, almost annually, on seme of the marshes 1 knew most familiarly. Tlie Teal builds a nest ot\\\" abundance of different vegetable substances, varying according to the locality and its productions, and luies it with down and feathers, the concealment afforded by the neiglibouring herb^e being carefully adopted. Eight to ten or twelve eggs are laid, of a buffy-white, If inch long by rather over 1^ broad. 250. WIGEON\\u2014 (^\\u00ab\\u00ab5 Penelope). Wliewer, V^Hum. \\u2014 Mr. Watertou has recorded an observation on the habits of this Duck, which is of great interest. Whereas, all the birds of the Duck-kind which we have hitherto named arp night-feeders, the Wigeon obtains its food by day, \\\" and that food is grass.\\\" The great body of our winter visitors of this species retire to the north to breed about the end of March, or April ; but a few have been ascertained to remain for that purpose in north Scotland. A nest, found on Loch Laighal in Sutherlandshire, was \\\" placed in the midst of a clump of grass, and was made of decayed rushes and reeds, with a lining of its own dowTi. The eggs were smaller than tliose of the Wild Duck, and of a rich cream-white colour.\\\" The number of eggs laid varies between five and eight or nine; the length, 2\\\\ inches by 1| in breadth. 251. AMERICAN TV^GEON\\u2014 (^\\u00aba5 Americana^ Of entirely rare and accidental occurrence. 252. EIDER ^^^^^\\u2014{Somatena mollissima), St. Cuthbert's Duck. \\u2014 We have now arrived at another section of the Duck family. Those hitherto named all frequent the fresh waters, and chiefly affect those that are of no great extent or depth. These, the first of which we have just named, frequent the sea or, in a few instances, the deepest parts of large freshwater lakes. The Eider Duck, well-known to most of us by t 146 BRITISH BIRDS, THEIR EGGS AND NESIS. name, to some of us by sight, breeds in some marshes on tb\\u00bb? Faroe islands, and in many of the islands on the coast of Scotland. The nests are principally composed, on a foundation of sea-weed cr grass, of the beautiful light elastic down, commonly known aa Eider-down ; and if the first is plundered, a second, and even \\u00bb third are formed ; but the down decreases in quality and quantity in each successive instance. The first accumulation is so large and springy as quite to conceal the eggs contained, which are usually five in number, and are of a light-green colour, about three inches long by two wide. The lining of one nest, admitting of easy compression by the hand, is described oy Mr. Hewitson as capable, when fully expanded, of filling a man's hat. 253. KING DJJCK\\u2014iSomaieria spectabilis). A much rarer bird than the last ; indeed occurring only very casually. It has been known to breed in one of the Orkney Islands, wliile Iceland, Nova Zcmbla, Spitzergen, and like localities, are the great breeding haunts of the species. The nests are made on the ground, and contain five eggs, very closely resembling the Eider-duck's, except in size. They are rather less. 254. STELLER'S WESTERN DUCK\\u2014 (Po.>5/eV/rt Stelleri). Exceedingly rare in Britain, and not much less so, it seems, in. Eui'ope generally. 255. \\\\T:LVET ^COTm.\\u2014{Oidemiafusca). Velvet Duck. \\u2014 A winter visitor, and rare on our south coasts. More common in the far north of Britain. 256. COMMON SCOTER.\\u2014 {Oidemia nigra). Scoter, Black Scoter, Black Duck, Black Diver. \\u2014 This duskycoloured Duck is seen in considerable numbers on various parts of our coasts in winter, and always swimming and diving in what may be called \\\" loose order,\\\" like the Coots rather than any TUFTED DUCK. 147 of the true Ducks. It does not, however, ever stay to breed with us, and can have no further notice nere. 257. SURF ^C01^K\\u2014{0idemia perspicillata). A bird of very rare, and, perhaps also it may be added, very local occurrence. 258. IIED-CRESTED WHISTLING Ji\\\\]CYi\\u2014{Fuligula rufina). Again another occasional vistor. 259. YOQjVLKSSi\\u2014iFuUgulafenna). Dunbird, lled-hcaded Wigeon, lied-headed Poker, Duncur. \\u2014 A whiter visitor, and in very considerable numbers in districts where the presence of inland waters to a s'xfBcient extent enables them to follow out then- natural habits. It is ahnost impossible, from their great quickness and skill in diving, to take them with tlie other \\\" Fowl \\\" in the Decoy, and they are therefore captured by a peculiar arrangement of nets affixed to poles so heavily weighted at one end as on being Liberated to elevate the net in such a way as to intercept the flight of the birds, as soon as they are fairly on wing. The Dimbu'd does not now breed in this country. 260. FERRUGINOUS DUCK\\u2014 (i^\\u00ab%\\u00ab/a nyroca). Somewhat resembling the Pochard in general hue, but smaller, and in respect of the numbers in which it has been met with in this country, comparatively a very rare visitor. 261. SCAUP DUCK\\u2014 (i^\\u00ab%/^/\\u00ab marila). Spoon-bill Duck. \\u2014 A winter visitor, and not an unusual one, although its numbers are never such as to commend it to notice in the same way as the Wild Duck, the Dunbird, the Wigeon, and some others. It breeds commonly in Iceland, but never in Britain. 262. TUFTED DUCK\\u2014 (i^\\u00ab%a& cristata). Another constant winter visitor, and as well or better known than the Scaup. Like the Scaup Duck it usually prefers oozy or muddy estuaries and their customary accompaniments. But L 2 148 BRITISH BIRDS, THJCIR EGGS AlUJJ StarB. have met willi it here in the narrow, rapid trout-stream which 1 uiis through this part of the country, and at a distance of not less than nine or ten miles from the sea. It breeds sparingly iu Holland and in more northerly countries. 2G3. LONG-TAILED T>VCY^\\u2014{Fulignla glasialii). Another bird wliicli, like the two last, is sufficiently wellknown witnout Demg exceedingly or indeed in the least degree numerous. It is in fact a rather rare and very beautiful Duck, and is remarkable for the great variations of plumage to which it 13 liable, according to differences of age, sex, and season. It breeds abundantly in Norway and Denmark, and much more so in puj-ely Arctic regions. 204. HAllLEQUIN DUCK\\u2014 (2^\\u00ab%a/\\u00ab histrionica). Another very beautiful bird, and most peculiarly marked. So much so as to remind its sponsors, as it appears, of the artistic effects produced by tlie customary pictorial adoriunent of our facetious friend Harlequin's face. A rarer bird, however, than even the Long-tailed Duck last named. 2C5. GOLDEN YXE\\u2014iFuligula clangula). Brown-headed Duck, Grey-lieaded Duck, Pied Wigeon, Goldeneyed Wigeon, Duck or Teal, Morillon, Rattlewings. \\u2014 As well known and as common as perhaps either the Scaup or the Tufted Duck, but known by different names according to the \\u2022tate of plumage depending on sex and age, females and young oirds being much more common than adult males. As not known to breed in England no notice of nest or eggs can be inserted here. In the Appendix, 'lowever, a very interesting notice of one of its habits connected with its breeding time will be inserted. 2GG. BUEEEL-HEADED DUCK\\u2014 (2^^%k/\\u00ab albeola). A visitor, but a very rare one, to our shores in winter. GOOSANDER. 149 207. SMEW\\u2014 (3/\\u00ab?;y/k\\u00ab albelliis). ^Hiite Nun, Red-headed Smew (for young), Smec, Lougn Diver, \\\"VVhite-lieaded Goosander. 'Uliite Merganser. \\u2014 This biru nelps us from tlie group of sea-loving Ducks jast noticed to that of the Mergansers, whose diving habits and powers may be interred from their names. Tiie Smew is perhaps quite the most common of tlie entire family; but they are very wary and difficult to api)roach. They are not known to breed m any part of the United Kingdom. 26S. HOODED :MERGx\\\\.NSER\\u2014 (^Ver^K* cvcuUatus). k. rare and accidental visitor to this country, and indeed to the European continent. 169. RED-BREASTED MERGANSER\\u2014 (.l/er^K* serrator. Red-breasted Goosander. \\u2014 This handsome bird is an undoubted denizen of our country during the breeding season, but in nr> great numbers in any year or district. It breeds in Ireland, on islands in several of the Loughs ; also in the Hebrides and otjier Scottish islands. The nest is made of long grass or moss, small roots, di-y water-herbage, mixed and lined with the bird's own down, doubtless added to as incubation proceeds. It is often placed at the foot of a tree, if there be one on the islet selected. The eggs are six to nine in number, of a pale buff or fawncolour. They are 2| inches long by If broad. 270. GOOSANDER.\\u2014 (J/er^\\u00ab5 merganser). Dun Diver, Sparling Fowl, Jacksaw, Saw-biU. \\u2014 A few of these birds also remain to breed in Britain, though by far the most retire to the north of Europe for that purpose. Its nests are common in both the Orkney Islands and the Hebrides. They are large, made of dry grass and roots, and lined with the down of ^le female, and placed amid bushes or stones, or in some cavity afforded by an old tree. The eggs rarely exceed six or seven, 150 BKITISII BIKDS, THEIR EGGS AND NESTS. not varying much in shade from those last descnbed, and are 2| inches in length, by nearly ] | in breadth. II.\\u2014 COLTMBIDtE. 271. GREAT CRESTED GR'EBK\\u2014{Podiceps crisiains}. Cargoose, Loon, Greater Loon, Tippet Grebe. \\u2014 We have come now to the Divers properly so called, and the family of Grebes to be noticed first are to be looked upon as principally out not exclusively, frequenting the fresh water. The bii-d now under notice remains almost all the year on the large sheets of water which it inhabits in Wales, Shropshire, Norfolk, and Lincolnshire. Like the rest of the Grebes, it is little able to walk and not much disposed to fly, but possessing marvellous capacity and power of diving. Its nest is made of a large heap of half rotten waterweeds, but little raised above the surface of the water, and always soaked with wet. On this likely-seeming place for duly addling every egg deposited, three, four or five eggs are laid, which are almost white when newly di'opped, but soon become so stained from constant contact with wet and decaying vegetable substances as to be any colour rather than white. They are about 2i inches long, by 1^ broad. The eggs, in the absence of the parent bu'd, are usually found covered with portions of some water vegetable ; and the owner, on being disturbed on her nest, always dives away from it. The first lessons of the young Loon in diving are taken beneath the literal \\\" shelter of their mother's wing.\\\" 272. RED-CRESTED GR'EBR\\u2014iPodiceps rubnccUis), Not so common as the Grebe last named, and more frequently met with on salt water, though not usually far from some estuary or inland arm of the sea. It is cot known to iiave bred in thia country. LlTlLli GREBE. ]51 273. SCLAVONIAN GR'EB'E\\u2014iPodicejJs cornutm). Dusky Grebe, Horned Grebe. \\u2014 Rather a rare bird in tlie summer, and not common at any period of tiie year; nor has it ever been known to breed with us. 274. EARED GREBE\\u2014 (Po(//c^s awnto). The rarest of all the Grebes. It occurs however from time to time, and I knew of one instance in Esses some thirty years ago in which one of these birds was taken from a \\\"Water-Rat's hole into which it had been seen to creep for shelter. 275. LITTLE GREBE\\u2014 (Por//c^^5 minor). Dabchick or Dobchick, Didapper, Small Ducker, Blackchiu Grebe. \\u2014 A very common and very interesting little bird, and yet, in spite of its frequency and familiarity, blessed with a couple of scientific names, originating (as in the case of the Dunlin), in differences of plumage, depending on age or season. It is difficiJt to say where it is 7wt to be met with in spring, provided only there be what the Americans call a sufficient \\\" waterprivilege,\\\" neither too shallow nor too rapid, for its requirements. As expert a diver as any of those hitherto named, it seldom resorts to the use of its wings, except just at the time when bu'ds' lovemakuig goes on. Then the male (at least) may be seen working his short wings most vigorously and rapidly, uttering his rattling cry as he circles over and about the Mere on which he has \\\" squatted \\\" for the season. The nest is a lieap of water weeds only just flush with the surface, and always steeping wet. The eggs are four, five or six in number, perfectly white when laid, but soon ceasing to be clean-looking, for they grow more dingy day by day, until on some waters they become completely mudcoloured, on others, assume a hue which I can compare to nothing but old blood stains on some du-ty surface. I am quite convinced that in some cases at least this discolouration is intentional on the 152 BRlTlSn BIRDS, THEIR EGGS AND KEtTS. part of the parent bird, though in others it may be simpl^f due tc the action of the juices of fresh or decaying vegetable substances I never yet, though I have seen some dozens of nests, found the eggs left uncovered by the owner, save only in one instance, in which only one egg had been laid. The weeds used as a covering were, moreover, in the majority of instances, fresh, and evidently procured by the Dabchick in virtue of her skill in diving. The young birds swim and dive almost immediately they are hatched, and are very persevering little skulkers if disturbed on their breeding waters. 276.

There seems good reason to think some of them may breed in some of the most northerly British Islands, but no authentic history of its ever naving been known to do so, is, I believe, extant. 277. BLACK-TIIROATED DIVLR\\u2014 (Co/ymi\\u00abs ardicus). Lumme, Norlliern Doucker, Speckled Loon. \\u2014 The rarest of the three Divers known in our seas. It is, however, described as breeding in several ol the lakes of Sutherlandshire. It makes no nest, but lays its two eggs on the bare ground, at no great distance from the water-edgo. These aie in some instances of a light shade of chocolate-brown, others having more of an olive-brown tinge about them, and sparingly spotted with black. 278.

It breeds on the Scottish mainland, m Shetland, in the Hebrides, and until lately in the Orkneys. The eggs are said to be always deposited very near the water's edge. They are two in number, of a greenisli brown colour, spotted with very dark brown, but, as Mr. Yarrell states, when the egg has been long sat upon the brown groundcolour is apt to assume a chestnut, or dark reddish-brown tint.

Foolish Guillemot, \\\"VVillock, Tinkershere, Tarrock, Scout, Sea- Hen, Murre, Lavy. \\u2014 The first on the list of our Ptockbirds, as they are often called. It is remarkable in several particulars connected with its breeding peculiarities. It makes no nest and lays but one egg, but that an egg of huge dimensions as contrasted with the size of the bird itself; besides which, it is almost impossible out of a collection of many scores to pick out half a dozen that are precisely alike, either in ground-colour or general markings. The eggs are laid on the ledges of rocky precipices overhanging the sea, on various parts of the British coasts. 1 have frequently seen the \\\"VVDlocks under the impulse of a sudden alarm \\u2014 for instance, the firing of a gun in the close vicinity of their egg-bestrown ledges \\u2014 fly off in very large numbers and with every symptom of precipitation. But no egg is ever dislodged ; a cii'cumstance which some Have sought to account for on the supposition that they must be cemented to the rockj The explanation really is, it would seem, that the shape of the eggs is such that, instead of rolling off in any direction, as a :.all would do on being sufficiently moved, they simply turn round ana vour.i witliin the length of their own axis. It would serve 154 BKlTlin BIRDS, TUEIR EGGS AXD NESTS. but little purpose to attempt a description of the Guillemot's figg. They are of all shades, from nearly or quite white to a dark green, some profusely spotted and blotched and streaked with, dark colours, others very slightly so or scarcely at all. Unfortunately the egg is so large that but two illustrations can be given in the limited space available to us. \\u2014 Fiff. 1, 2, j}late X. 280. BRUNNICH'S GUILLEMOT\\u2014 (Z7n\\u00ab Brunnichii). Thick-billed Guillemot. \\u2014 Easily distinguished by an experienced eye from the last, but a bird of which, perhaps, it can scarcely be said that it has been actually ascertained to breed any where within the limits of the British Isles. The eggs are described as varying from those of the Common Guillemot in their greater roundness ; they are less long in proportion to their thickness than the others, but seem to run through the sanitj endless variations of ground-colour. 281. RINGED GUILLEMOT\\u2014 (^/-/^ lacrpnans). Bridled Guillemot. \\u2014 There has been some doubt whether this bird is to be considered a distinct species, or merely a variety of the Common Guillemot. It is now, however, generally admitted as a good species. It occurs in company with the other Guillemot on various parts of our coasts, and in Wales is said to be equally numerous with it. The eggs are distinguishable from those of the other two species already named, but still exhibiting precisely similar characteristics. 282. BLACK GUILLEMOT\\u2014 (6Vi\\u00ab^;y//e). Tyste, Seraber, Greenland Dove, Sea Turtle. \\u2014 Sensibly less in size than the Common Guillemot, and not found commonly on our more southerly coasts. Shetland, the Orkneys and Western Isles are all frequented by thcin, and their quick and lively motions are pleasant enough to witness. These birdv lay two eggs each instead of one, in holes or crevices of pre\\u00ab PUFHN. 135 cipitous rocks, and at some distance from the aperture ; sometimes, where no such nest-sites are available, on the bare ground, under or between fragments of rock or large stones. They are most commonly white more or less tinged with blue, specklea, spotted and blotched or marbled with chestnut brown, very dark brown and a kind of neutral tint. \\u2014 Fig. 3, plate X. 283. LITTLE A.\\\\]K\\u2014(Merffidus melanoleucos). I have rarely seen any bird, much more a very small bird like this, whose whole air and deportment conveyed to me more completely the idea of entire independence. Only under the pressure of severe storms or long continued hard weather do they leave the deep sea in order to seek the comparative shelter of some land-sheltered bay or reach. It breeds on the Faroe Isles and in Iceland, but not in Britain. 284. '2'[]Y'Sl'^\\u2014{Fra(ercula arctica). Sea Parrot, Coulterneb, Tammy Norie. \\u2014 This is, one may safely say, the quaintest-looking of all the host of our Enghsh birds. The young Owl is grotesque enough, but more by reason of its deliberate, solemn-seeming and yet laughable movements; but the P uffin , with its upright attitude and liuge ribbed and painted beak \\u2014 reminding one somewhat strongly of the highly-coloured pasteboard noses of preposterous shape and dimensions wliich decorate the windows of the toy-shop \\u2014 strikes us as more laughably singular yet. They breed abundantly about many of our rocky coasts m all parts of the kingdom, depositing their one egg \\u2014 a large one, again, in proportion to the size of the bird \\u2014 sometimes in crannies or rifts in the surface of the cliff, often very far back ; at other times in rabbit-buiTows where such excavations ore to be met with sufficiently near the coast and otherwise suitable to the wants of the bird.

They have their habits their food, their haunts, even to a great degree their general appearance, in conunon. There is, however, a great difference both in the shape and size and also in the colouring of the single egg laid by the Hazor-blll, from that of the Willock. It is less in proportion, less elongated, wants the infinite diversity of colouring which characterises the cg^ of the latter, the ground-colour being always whitish or white tinged with some light buffy shade, and the spots and blotches, which are siifficiently abundant, are some of a reddish or chestnut brown, others of a very deep rich brown. \\u2014 Fig. 4, flute X. 2S0. GREAT AUK\\u2014 (^/crt impemis). Gair-Fowl. \\u2014 Not merely an exceedingly rare British bird, but It is to be feared, extinct as a British species. Where it is yet ia existence it is said scarcely ever to leave the water, and it lays its one large egg almost close to high-water mark. These eggt are white in ground, or sometimes soiled or slightly yellowish wliite, blotched and streaked, most at the larger end, with black. They somewhat resemble the Guillemot's (^g in shape, but are rather less elongated. The value of these eggs is aimost suAG, L57 fabulous, sixty guineas* bavinej been given for a couple of them. I have to thank Mr. Chanipley, C.E., of Scarborough, for most kindly sending me an engraving of a Great Auk's egg in his possession, as well as for offering me access to his admirable coilection of eggs, numbering upwards of SOOO specimens.

Crested Cormorant, Corvorant, Great Black Cormorant, Cole Goose, Skart. \\u2014 \\\"V^Hierever there are any traces of a rocky coast about our island, there the Cormorant is pretty sure to be found, so that he may very well be described as a common bird. Where the rocky coast is not only extensive, but not liable to much disturbance from human intrusion, these birds abound, and may be seen in numbers and observed to anyone's heart's content- They build their nests, which arc of ample size, with sticks, seaweed and coarse herbage of any obtainable sort, on ledges of the precipices ; and many nests are usually formed in the near neighbourhood of each other. They are much disposed also to select as the situation for their nests a rocky islet with cliffy sides, and woe to the nose of anyone who approaches such an island-rock from the leeward side. What from the nature of their food and the abundance of their excrement, an intolerably fetid odour always prevails about their breeding-place. The eggs vary in number from four to six, and are almost entirely covered over with a white chalky incrustation, which, however, admits of easy removal by a knife or similar means, leaving a shell of a bluishgreen colour apparent. 2S8.

As to habits and haunts the differences are not great. The Shags are said to breed lower down on the rocks than the Cormorant, and the nests are principally composed of sea weed and grasses. The eggs are three to five in number, and covered with the same incrustation as those of the Cormorant, and equally removable. White at first, they soon become as soiled and stained as tliose of the Grebes. 2S9. GANNET.\\u2014 (/S^fe Bassana).

When the breeding time comes round, they congregate in hosts of many thousands at some half-dozen different stations, particularly affected by them on different parts of our coasts. During the breeding season they become exceedingly tame, and wiU even suffer themselves to be touched. Tliey make their nests of a large mass of sea weed and dry grass, on rather than in which they lay each one single tg^, of no very considerable size. This, when first laid, is white or bluish-white, (the colour being dae to an incrustation similar to that of the Cormorant's egg), but soon becomes soiled and stained. v.\\u2014 LAEID^. 290. CASPIAN TEllN\\u2014 (67fra\\u00ab Caspta). The first member of the last Family of British birds, comprising many birds of habits and peculiarities as widely distinct, when it is remembered they are all water-birds, from those of the two Families last nader notice, as is readily conceivable. The Grebes, Divers, Cormorants, all gifted with wonderful powers of diving; the Gulls and Terns incapable of diving an inch; the latter, buoyant and bitting as lightly on the water as a cork ; the former deep-sunken ROSEATE TERN. 15^ in the water, and seeming to require almost an effort to support themselves on the surface at all. The contrast is certainly sufficiently striking, \\u2022vrlthout taking into account that the one group has immense power of flight, and exercises it ; and the others seem to have little inclination to use their wings at all, more than is absolutely necessary. The handsome and large Tern, specially under notice, does not breed in this country, but is known to inhabit the coast of some parts of the European continent, at no great distance from our own shores. 291.--SAND-WICII TI^'R'N\\u2014iS/erna Cantiaca). This bird has been noticed as breeding in several different localities on our southern coasts, and it is known to frequent both Coquet Island and one or more of the Fame Islands for the same purpose. It lays three or four eggs in a hole, or rather cavity, either scratched or found ready-made in the neighbourhood of plants or herbage sufScient to afford some covert. The colour of the eggs varies from yellowish white to a buffy stonecolour, and they are thickly spotted with neutral tint, chestnut and deep rich brown. There is, indeed, considerable variat ion m the colouring of the eggs, but all are very beautiful. \\u2014 Fig. ], 2, vlate XI. 292. ROSEATE TEK^\\u2014 {Sterna Doyffallii). This bird is now known to be a regular but not abundant summer visitor. Unlike many of our recognised British Birds, this Tern seems rather to increase in numbers than to diminish. They associate with other and infinitely more common species, and closer observation only lias distinguished between them and their eggs and those of their more numerous associates. The eggs of the Roseate Tern are two or three in number, and vary among themselves to some small extent. They are usually of a 160 BRITISH BIRDS, THEIR EGGS AND NESTS. liglit yellowish stone-colour, spotted and speckled with dark-p;re? and dark-brown. 293. COMMON TERN\\u2014 (<S/\\u00ab-\\u00ab\\u00ab hirundo). Sea Swallow, Tarney or Pictamey, Tarrock, Pirr, Gull-teazer, &c. \\u2014 ^Although distinguished by the epithet of Common, this Tern is really not much more numerous, and in that sense common, than one or two other species with which it customarily consorts. It is very generally diffused however, and in that sense w common. It usually biulds on the ground in marshy localities near large sheets of water, or on islands low and flat not far from the sea. Sometimes, though more rarely, it builds upon low rocks or slightly elevated sand-banks. They lay two or three eggs, and are exceedingly and noisily restless and uneasy when they, or especially their yoiuig, are too nearly approached. Their eggs vary a good deal, but most of them are of a medium stone-colour, blotched and spotted with ash-grey and dark red-brown. The buoyancy and power of flight exhibited by these birds is very observable. \\u2014 Fij. 3, 'plate XT. ARCTIC TERN\\u2014 (iS^eraa ardica). This Tern, until a comparatively recent period, was confounded with the Common Tern, but a clear specilic difference was pointed out by M. Temmiuck, and it is now acknowledged that, in maiiy of the more nortlierly localities especially, it is a much more numerous species than the Common Tern. It breeds plentifully m Shetland, Orkney and some parts of the Hebrides, and in great numbers on Coquet Island and one or more of the Fames. It lays two or three eggs, which are exceedingly like those of tiie Common Tern, and vary in the same proportion. Some have 3 ijreenish shade, and others rather a pronounced buff, spotted and BUCK TERN. 161 blotched as ;n the case of those of the last-named specica. \\u2014 Fig. 4, plate XI. 295.

It seems to prefer sand or shinglebanks or surfaces, and lays its two or three eggs in any small cavity which it may be lucky enough to find in the selected place. It is perfectly surprising in many cases how closely the eggs laid resemble the stones and gravel among which they are laid. They are palish stone-colour, speckled and spotted with ash-grey and dark brown. \\u2014 Fig. 5, plate XI. 298. BLACK TEK^\\u2014iSierna nigra). Blue Darr. \\u2014 These birds show considerable varieties in plumage, according to sex and age. They used to be very much more numerous than they now are, many of their favourite haunts having been drained or otherwise broken up. Still it is not uncommon, even yet, in some parts of the fenny districts \\u2014 g'.though other Terns build in the close vicinity of the sea, atid in dry sites. The Black Tern, however, selects marshy places and often builds in very wet spots, making a nest of flags and grass. The eggs are sometimes four in number, this being the only Tern which lays more than three. They vary much in colour and markings, some being of a palish green, others of a brownish yellow, or dull buff, but all spotted and blotched with deep brown.

Brown-headed Gull, Red-legged Gull, Laughing Gull, Pewit Gull, Black-cap, Sea Crow, Hooded Mew. \\u2014 This is a very numerous, and at least, at some periods of the year, a very generally diffused species. At the breeding time, although a few pairs may be met with in an infinite number of localities, the great bulk of the species seems to collect at a few chosen places. One such place, in wliich they breed in thousands, is on Scoulton Mere, in Norfolk ; another at PaUinsburn, in Northumberland ; and a tliird, in Lincolnsliire, not fur from Brigg. The nests are made of sedges, grass and the flowering part of the reed, and are not very deeply cup-sliaped. The bird lays three eggs, and there is a very great degree of variation between them in respect of colour and markings ; the ground-colour being sometimes of a light blue or yellow, and sometimes green, or red, or brown. Some, too, are thickly covered with spots, and others scarcely marked with a single speckle or spot. In more than one of their great COMMON GULL. 103 breeding-places the right or gathering the eggs is rented, and sonaetimes upwards of a thousand eggs are collected in a single day. When the first laying of eggs is taken, a second batch, and even a third is produced ; but in each successive instance, the eggs become less. They are used as the Pewit's eggs are, and also for culinary purposes, being sold for about fivepence a score. \\u2014 Fig. 7, plate XI. 304. LAUGHING-GULL\\u2014 (Z\\u00abrK5 atricilla).

It places its nest of sea-weed high up on the face of some rocky steep on a narrow ledge, and deposits therein, for the most part, three eggs. These differ much in colour and in the amount and position of the spots ; some are stone-coloured, some tinged with an olive shade, and some with a bluish cast.

I have seen it abundantly at Flamborough Head and St. Abb's Head, and in smaller numbers on many parts of the Yorkshire coast north of Flamborough, as well as in. others not distant from St. Abb's. It usually selects for the site of its nest a flat ledge or other rock-surface towards the upper part of the cliff ' but win sometimes build on a low rock or grassy island. Tht. nest is like that of the last species, but even larger, and usually contains three eggs. These so strongly resemble those of the Lesser Black-back as to make it very difficult to distingush between the one and the otlier. Mr. Hewitson says the only means of distinction available even to an experienced eye seem to depend on the somewhat greater size of the Herring Gull's egg, and the larger and more confluent character of the blotches of surface colour. \\u2014 Fig. 4, plate XII. 311. GREAT BLACK-BACKED Gl]l.L\\u2014(Larusmarinus). Black-back, Cob, Great Black-and-white GuU. \\u2014 By no means a numerous species, and not affecting society as so many of the other Gulls do. It breeds, in some cases, on the Marsh or Saltingspaces met with so abundantly on some, of the southern and eastern shores ; but more commonly on rocky parts of the coast. Thus, it breeds very abimdautly on the Orkney and Shetland Islands. Tlic nest is made of a large quantity cf dry grass simply thrown together. The eggs are three in number, often bearing a great resemblance to those of tlie two species last 166 BlUTISU BIRDS, TUEIU EGGS AND KES18. named, but usually distinguishable by the larger masses of surface colouring, and by some superiority in size. The Black back's eggs are much esteemed as articles of food, or for cooking purposes generally. The yolk is very deep and rich-coloured, and the white colourless or transparent. Each female wUl lay tliree sets of eggs ; the first two sets being, in some cases, customarily taken, and the last left for her to hatcn. 312. GLAUCOUS GJJLlj\\u2014iLarusfflaucus). Large White-winged GuU, Burgomaster. \\u2014 A GuU equally large with the last, one of which, shot by myself, exceeded six feet from the tip of one wing to that of the other ; but one of merely casual occurrence as a British bird. 313. COMMON SKUK\\u2014iLesMs catarrades). Skua GuU, Brown GuU, Bonxie. \\u2014 We pass here into a somewhat different class of birds. The Skua is as bold and insolent as most of the GuUs are timid and retiring. In many instances these birds do not take the trouble to fish for themselves, but, watching the fishing operations of the Gull, seize their opportunity of assailing a successful fisher, and compel him to disgorge his prey. The Common Skua has only a very limited breedmgrange in Britain, not beiag known to nest out of Shetland, and to have but three places for nidification there. So resolute and daring are they when they have young to defend, they do not scruple to attack the eagle, and a pair have been known to beat the strong, proud marauder effectually off. The Skua makes a large nest of moor-growing moss, and takes some pains in its construction. It is placed among the heath and moss of a hiUy island. The eggs are two in number, and vary much in coloui- ; according to locality it would almost seem. Some are dusky FULMAR PETREL. 167 olive brown, others with a much greener hue, and they are blotched with darker brown, and a few spots of rust colour. 314. POMARINE SKV A.\\u2014{Lestris Pomarinus). Merely a casual visitor, although more frequently noticed of late years than before ornithology became so favourite a study. 315. RICHARDSON'S SKUA\\u2014 (Zes^m Richardsonii). Arctic Gull, Black-toed Gull, Arctic Skua. \\u2014 This species is the most numerous of all those which visit this country. It breeds in the Hebrides, in the Orkneys and in Shetland, and numerously enough in the two localities last named. The female has been observed to make use of the same artifices as the Partridge and the Grouse to decoy an intrusive dog or man away from its nest or young. The nest is built of moss or ling, on some elevated knoll amid marshy ground, or on the moor, and coutaius two eggs. These are of a greenish olive-brown colour, spotted with dark browni. This Skua not only restlessly and pitilessly persecutes the Kittiwake and other Gulls in order to obtain its own food from them at second-hand, but also makes free with their eggs for the same purpose in a very marauder-like fashion. \\u2014 Fir/. 5, plate Xlf. 316. BUEEON'S SKUA\\u2014 (Ze^^m Buffonii). Mr. Yarrell distiaguishes between this bird and the true L. Parasiticus, and consequently adopts the scientific name I have now given. This Skua can only be considered a rare and accidental visitor. 317. FULMAR PETREL\\u2014 (P;-oceJ&r?\\u00ab glacialis). Fulmar, Northern Fulmar. \\u2014 The Fulmar breeds in incredible numbers at St. KUda, but is rarely met with, even in winter, about the southern coasts of England. Both old birds and their young on being touched eject a considerable quantity of 168 BRITISH BIRDS, THEIR EGGS AND XESTS. clear oil, v/hicli, however, is by no means of an agreeable odour ; and probably from this cause the nest, young birds, and even the rock on which they are placed, stink almost intolerably. The nest is very slight, if any, and the bird lays her single white egg in little excavations, and lightly lined, on such shelves on the face of high precipitous rocks as are surfaced with a little grass or sward. The egg varies in length from a Httle over 2i inches to 3 inches. 318. GREATER SHEARWATER\\u2014 (P#\\u00ab2\\u00ab major). Cinerous Shearwater, Dusky Shearwater. \\u2014 A bird which has not been very frequently recorded as met with on the British seas, but still one of occasional occiirrence. 319. :MANX SHEARWATER\\u2014 (P\\u00ab#\\u00abm5 Angiorum). Shearwater Petrel, Manx Puffin. \\u2014 This is a regular sea-taring little bird, and perhaps would hardly ever care to come to land if it weie not for the need of something solid for its eggs to repose upon. It usually frequents islands well-washed by the sea and not much frequented by men. It used to be very abundant on the Calf of Man, but is never seen there now. In one of the Scilly Islands it breeds in some numbers still, and on St. KUda, the Western Isles, Orkney and Shetland. The nest is made deep down in a hole in some wild and half inaccessible part of the islands frequented, and in it one egg ot exceeding whiteness is laid, and remarkable for the fine texture ot the shell amd the musky scent of the entire egg. It is about 2\\\\ inches long by 1| broad. 320. BULWER'S '\\u00a3'^TKEL\\u2014{Thalassidroma Bulwerii). A Petrel of sufficiently rare occurrence. 321. WILSON'S PETREL\\u2014 (7%tftes\\u00abc?ro\\u00bb?fl Wilsont). Equally rare with the bird last-named. STORM PETREV 169 322. FORK-TAILED VETnYL\\u2014iThahssidroma Leachii). Subject to tlie same remark as the two last. 323. STORM \\\"BETMli\\u2014^Thalassidroma procellaria). Mother Carey's Chicken. \\u2014 This is said to be the smallest webfooted bird known, and it is the last as well as the least. It nevei comes to the shore except at the breeding-season, and only seeks comparative shelter under the pressure of very heavy weather. It breeds in the SciUy Islands, some of the islands on the Irish coast, and abundantly on St. Kilda, the Orkneys and Shetland. They breed in holes in a cliff, or under large-sized stones, which, from their great size and the accumulation of boulders and large shingle about them, afford many deep recesses well suited to the wants of the nesting Petrel. Like the Manx Shearwater, they are by no means silent m. their nest-holes, but make themselves distinctly audible to the passenger above. They lay one white esrg, a little exceediag 1 inch long, by J nroad. * TJie simpUst and best way ofblovying eggs is to drill a hole in one side [not at the ends), then taking the egg, hole downwards, between the finger and thumb of the left hand, place the blowpipe pioint jicst outside the hole, and blow into the egg ; this will force out the contents. When this is done, blow a little clean water into the egg, and shake it well; then remove the \\\\oater in the same way as a.bove, and allow the egg to dry, hole downwards, on blotting paper ; it will then be quite clean. APPENDIX. Our object in adding this Appendix is simply a wish to make the book more complete by adding notices, more or less detailed, of the nests and eggs and any interesting breeding-season peculiarities of birds recognized as really well entitled to the name of British Birds, but not happening to remain within the limits of Britain to breed. The first bird of the kind i\\\" that which, in our complete list, is numbered 7. GREENLAND FAl.GON. The equivalent to Mr. Yarrell's Gyr Falcon. 8. ICELAND FALCON. These two species are now, I believe, looked upon as established, but the differences between them are not excessively striking, except it be to a scientific naturalist. Mr. Hewitson has figured an egg of tlie Iceland Falcon which he believes may have lost some of its colour. It was taken from a neat made with sticks and roots, lined with wool, which once perhaps was the nest of a Raven. The nest in question was in a cliff, and had the remains of manysortsof birds\\u2014 Whimbrels, Golden Plovers, GuUlemots, Ducks\\u2014 strewed round it. The egg is of a bufFy red colour, mottled and speckled\\u2014 very thickly in places\\u2014 with deeper red. 30. SNOWY OWL. SuflSciently often met withinNorth Britain (and even occurring sometimee in England) to merit a short notice here. It inhabits Sweden, Norway, Lapland and the greater part of Northern Europe. These birds are accustomed to take their prey by daylight, and seem, from the accounts received, to be 172 In the habit of\\\" bolting \\\" their food, when not vei-y largo, whole. It makes its nest on the ground, and lays in it three or four white eggs. 54. GREAT GEEY SHRIKE. This bird is met with in Denmark and other northern countries of Western Europe, and also in Russia, Germany and France, It is said to frequent wocds and forests, and to build upon trees at some distance from the ground, as well as in thick bushes and hedges. The nest is made of roots, moss, wool and dry stalks, lined with dry grass and root-fibres. The eggs are four to seven in number, and though they vary a good deal in colour, they always illustrate the peculiar tendency of the eggs of the Shrikes to show a sort of zone or girdle, due to the agglomeration of the spots about some part of the circumference. They are yellowish or greyish white, and the spots of grey and light brown. 42. FIELDFARE. I have sometimes seen this favourite game-bird of the sohool-boy here as early as the latter part of September, and I have frequently noticed them foeding in hundreds on the holly berries which abound in more than one part of this district. They must breed very late in the year from the late period of their departure hence, and the distance of the countries to which many of them resort for that purpose. It breeds very abundantly in Norway, and also in Sweden, Russia and Siberia, not to mention other and more southerly countries in Europe. Their nests, in Norway, are usually bailt ^gainst the trunk of the spruce-fir, and at very variable heights from the ground. They are said to be very like those of the Ring Ouzel, except that small twigs are added to th^i outside structure. The eggs are from three to five, and are very like those of the Ring Ouzel, but with somewhat more red about them. The Fieldfare seems to prefer breeding in numerous groups or colonies, two or three hundi ed nests oeuig frequently seen within a i'ather limited space. 43.' REDWING. This winter visitor is known to breed occasionally, but yet only very excopt'onally, in this country. A nest was brought to me two summers since, whicli, from its construction, the size and cokuring of the eggs, and espotially from the description of the bird which my informal. t saw leaving th\\u00ab APPENDIX. 173 D\\u00ab8t, I have little doubt was a Redwing. It breeds abundantly in Sweden and in lesser niimbexs in Norwaj , and is described as being a very sweet su;ger, as heard among the forest solitudes of the latter country. Its nest is very similar to those of the Blackbird, Ring Ouzel and Fieldfare, in materials and structure. The eggs are four to six in number, and very similar, allowing for a little inferiority in size, to those of the Fieldfare, and to very red specimens of the Uing Ouzel's. 91. SNOW BUNTING This bird resorts in the breeding-season to the \\\" Arctic Regions and tlie Islands of the Polar Sea.\\\" Mr. Yarrell says, \\\" the nest is composed of dry grass, neatly lined with deers' hair and a few feathers, and is generally fixed in a crevice of a rock, or in a loose pile of timber or stones. The eggs are a greenish white, with a circle of irregular umber-brown spots round the thick end, and numerous blotches of subdued lavender purple.\\\" 98. MOUNTAIN FINCH. This Finch is occasionally met with in sufficient numbers to be deserving of a short notice here. It seems to breed in Denmark, Norway, and Lapland, and it is at least possible that a few pairs may, from time to time, stay to nest with us. It is said to build in fir-trees, though from Mr. Hewitsou's account, the nests are by no means easy to find. The following is an account of a nest made by a pair in an aviary at Becclcs in Suffolk : \\u2014 \\\" Tlie nest was deep, the walls thick, a large quantity of materials employed for the foundation which was worked among the stalks of the ivy-leaves. It was composed of moss, wool, and dry grass ; and lined with hair.\\\" The general appearance of the eggs is one of resemblance to those of the Chaffinch ; the spots however, seeming to be fewer, smaller and less decided. 104,. SISKI.X. This little bird lias been known in several instances to breed with us in its natural wild condition, but its nesting-home is in Russia, Germany and north-western Europe. It has been ascertained to build in furze bushes, and also close to the trunk of a fir-tree, where a projecting bough afforded support for the structure. The nest is composed of similar materials to the Chaffinchs', and the eggs present a good deal of resemblance to those of the Goldfinch, with a little inferiority in size. l74 170. TURNSTONE. This very handsomely pIumap;od. bird inhabits the countries bordering on the Baltic, as also Greenland and other localities far to the north. Mr. Hewitson gives a most interesting account of his discovery of its nest i\\u00bb Norway : \\u2014 \\\" We had visited numerous islands with little encouragemerand were about to land upon a flat rock, when our attention was attractet by the singular cry of a Turnstone. We remained in the boat a short tims until we had watched it behind a tuft of grass, near which after a minute search, we succeeded in finding the nest. It was placed against a ledge <x. the rock, and consisted of nothing more than the dropping leaves of the Juniper bush, under a creeping branch of which the eggs, four in number, were snugly concealed and sheltered.\\\" Several other nests were also found in the course of further researches, which, however, were required to be both close and systematic. The eggs are of an olive-green colour, spotted and streaked with different shades of red-brown, and \\\" all having a beautiful tint of purple or crimson, seen in few other eggs.'' 171. SANDERLING. It breeds in Greenland, Labrador and other Arctic countries. It makes its nest on marshy grounds, of grass, and lays four \\\" dusky- coloured eggs, spotted with black.\\\" But little seems to be known of either the nidification or the eggs of this species, as no figure is given by either Mr. Hewitson or in the Reverend O. Morris's book. 237. HOOPER. Occasionally met with during the breeding season in Iceland, and more commonly in Lapland. They are described as inhabiting the most remote and inaccessible lakes and morasses in forest districts. The nest is made of any coarse water herbage which is suitable and at the same time accessible. It is large, and raised some inches above the surface of the supporting soil. The eggs are believed to be from three or four to seven in number, and are usually of a uale brownish white colour, extending to about 4 inches long by 2J broad. 245. PINTAIL. This Duck breeds in Iceland, and commonly in Lapland and some of the iistricts about the Gulf of Bothnia. It builds, like most others of its kind APPENDIX. 175 among the thick herbage commonly growing near the edge of pieces of fresh water; the nest being made of tlie same, but dry, and lined with down. The eggs are six to eight or nine in number, and are of a light greenish white colour, and about the same size as those of the Wild Duck proper. 265. VELVET SCOTER. This Sea Duck is found in Russia, Norway, the Faroe Islands, and also in Iceland. Mr. Audubon's account of its nest and eggs is as follows :\\u2014 \\\" The nests are placed within a few feet of the borders of small lakes, a mile or two from the sea, and usually under the low boughs of the bushes, of the twigs if which, with mosses and various plants matted together, they are formed f hey are large and almost flat, several inches thick, with some feathers of the female, but no down, under the eggs, which are usually six in number, 2J inches in length, by If in breadth, of an uniform pale cream colour, tinged with green.\\\" 256, COMMON SCOTER. It breeds, but not very numerously, in Iceland ; but is seen nesting in company with the Velvet Scoter, in Scandinavia, rather more commonly. It makes a nest of any available vegetable substance, such as grasses, twigs, leaves, dry stalks ; it is lined with down, and placed under the partial cover or concealment afforded by low shrubs or other plants. The eggs are six or seven to ten in number, of a pale buff colour slightly tinged with green, 2i inches long by If broad. After the eggs are laid, the males aseemble in large flocks and draw towairds the coast. 259. POCHARD. The breeding-haunt of this bird seems to be more to the eastward than the mojority of those hitherto named. It is said to be abundant in Russia and in the north of Germany, and is very commonly found in the Fur-countries in America during the breeding-season. A few also breed on the Borders of the Meres in Holland. The nest is similar in site and materials to those of the Wild Duck and other Ducks, and the eggs sometimes reach the nimaber of twelve. They are of a greenish buff colour, 2 inches in length, by H in breadth. The Pochard was discovered, several years since 176 APPENDIX as breeding about the mere at Scarborough, and has also been stated to nest occasionally in one or two places in Tforfolk. 281. SCAUP DUCK. This Duck has also been known as breeding very incidentally in this coun\\u00ab. try, but its almost unbroken habit is to return to such countries as Iceland, the swampy lake-district north of the GiJf of Bothnia, and some parts of Norway, for nesting purposes. It sometimes makes its nest in wliat may be almost called the usual site for the nests of Ducks, and sometimes upon the stones and shinglo at the edge of sheets of fresh water. The nest is very thin and slightly formed, but well lined with down, and the eggs seem to be six, seven, or eight in number, They are of a pal 3 bulT colour, and sensibly less in size than those of the Pochard last named. 262. TUPTED DUCK. This little Duck is known to breed near the head of the Bothnian Gulf, as well as in oth er parts of Sweden, and in Lapland and Russia. A few pairs also are seen nesting in Holland. It makes a very slight nest of grasses and the like. The eggs are seven or eight to ten in number, very similar in shade to those of the Scaup Duck last mentioned, but much less in size, being only a little over 2 inches long, by less than 1\\\\ in breadth. 263. LONG-TAILED DUCK. It is known to breed in Iceland, and believed to do so in Norway. It makes its nest among low brushwoou and the herbage usual at or near tho margin of fresh water. A few stems of grass Ibrm the substructure, on which is placed a plentiful lining of down. The eggs are from six to twelve in number. They art of yellowish-white, just tinged with green, and nearly 2| inches long by IJ in breadth. 265. GOLDEN EYE. This Duck seems to prefer wooded or forest districts for nesting in. It breeds in Lapland, Sweden and Norway, and has such a strong liking for a hole in a tree to nest in, that if suitable boxes with an adequate entrance- AJr'PENUIX. 177 hole are placed <ai the trees growing on the banks of streams or lakes frequented by them, their eggs are su ro io be deposited therein, to the great profit of those who suspend theboxes. Of course when it isknowu that aDuck hatches its young in a hole in a tree, the question must suggest itself\\u2014 as it did to the original obserrer in the ease of the Wild Ducks' nest on a pollard, or in a Fir-tree \\u2014 How can the young Ducks ever be got down safely, and still more, finally launched on their proper element ? An observed habit of the Golden Eye answers this question. A Lap clergyman saw the parent bird conveying its young, to the number of five or more, but one at a time, from the nest to the water, and he was at last able to \\\" make out that the young bird was held under the bill, but supported by the neck of the parent.\\\" The eicgs of the Golden Eye are said to be ten or twelve or oven more in number, Hiid of a brighter colour than is usual with the eggs of the Duck tribe, being of a rather decided green colour. 267. SMEW. But little that is quite authentic seems to be known of the nesting habits of this little Duuk; nor is it certainly ascertained where its chief numbers retire to breed. The esgs are said to be eight or ten in number, or even more than that, and to be of a yellowish white colour. 270. GREAT NORTHERN DIVER. This bird breeds on the Faroe Islands, and on some of the lakes in Iceland ; as also on some of the islands of Finmark. Spitzbergen and Greenland are also named as the breeding resort of many of these Divers. They lay, it is supposed, two eggs each, though in some observed instances only one was to be seen. Mr. Audubon says that three are sometimes laid. They are of a dark olive-brown, with a few spota of dark umber brown, and are of considerable size \\u00a3S3. LITTLE A^JK, This little wave-dwclIer has its nesting home in countries far more r.o tho North than ours. It abounds on some parts cf the Greenland shores, and it is also met with but much more sparingly, iu Iceland. It makes no nest\\u00bb M ilS ArPENDlX. but lays its one egg on the ground amongst or possibly beneath the large rock-masses which encumber the shore after falling from the overhanging cliffs and precipices. The parent birds are exceedingly averse to leave theii egg when incubation has commenced, and like some other species already mentioned, will rather suffer themselves to be removed by the hand. Tha egg is white lightly tinged with blue, a little spotted and veined with rual colour. INDEX. Accentor, Alpine, 63. Auk Little, 155. Great, 15fi. Bivoeet, 125. Bee-Eater, 98. Blackbird, 51.

THE favourable reception given to the fit ft attempt atlbmething like a Register for the Year i8co, has induced the Editor to lay before the Public a volume more enlarged, and rather more methodical in its arrangement\\u2014but he does not expedl that to give complete fatisfadlion toothers, when he himlelf is conlciou8 of its defe\\u00abils. Amongfl many inconveniences with which he has had to contend, was much ill health, both in his own perfon, and in thofe of his workmen This, with his diftance from any ready help, and the difficulty he found in obtaining the necelfary intelligence, have prevented its appearance in the month of January, as he wiflied and expeoled. But as every misfortune is faid to bring along with it fonie alleviating circumflances, the book, in fadl, has gained by the accidental delay. The Kditor has had an opportunity of inlerting icveral important articles relative to the late Election of a Prefident, which otherwife would have been defered till next volume \\u2014 indeed he could nut with any propriety pafs over a tranfa6lioa which fo highly intereftcd the feelings of the new, and attracted the fcrioiis attention of the old world\\u2014 *' When the fword hung fufpended by a hair.\\\" If fmall matrers may be compared to great, in order to (hew our Readers the nature of the woik, the Englifli Annual Regider for the year 1799 was not publiflicd in September lall As a Record of what is pajl^ it is not necelfary it (hould appear exactly on the fir/l day of the new year like an x^hnanack \\u2014 And it may ealily be ima2,ined, that it takes ^omc time atid trouble to arrange and prepare materials even for ib fmall a work as theprefcnt. la the arrangement of the materials which compofe this little volume, it was the Editor's objc<5l to combine hillorical inflruclion, with a collection of the local events and occurrences of the year. His hiflorical ex- A tracts [ I. ] tracTs are taken from the beft authorities, and are ic- Icrtcd with a View, that the people of iliis couutiy might ihtre'.jy I'uiin a judgement of the nature of the coriupt and toterinj; Governments i>f \\\"Europe, and learn from thtni, lo appreciate the advantages which ihey enjoy ; and taking example fio u the awful fctn^s now acting in that part oi^ the world, to chcrifh an>l Jiipport a form of Government founded on the principles of jjftiee o.id natural right. Oa a review of the materials which he had collected, he ptrccived that he had as many as would make a \\\\ery thick OC:l:avo volume, all of them, in his opiniOi,, \\\\vorihy of prcfcrvation, tiihcr for yfe or entertaiiim^nt \\u2014 His chief labour, tlieieibre, has been, to reject a great many o( thefe articles, and (o lo contract diid cc/Uiprtl's others, as to bring tbe-m into fwch a couipafs as he tiiought would ht the fize uf his book, and enable him to fell it at a moderate price. It is eafy to Cce, that the Editor had in contemplation a puhlication fnnjlar to the En^lnii Annual Rcgifher, in which fhould be rec-oided the principal Adis of both the General and StateGovernmenis, the National Accounts, c^c. \\u2014 to iniert every article tending to encourage Agriciihure, Commerce, and IManuiaciurts, all ufeful inventiont and difcoveries, the molt ren^arkai>k occurrences of the year, &c, thefe to be enlivened wi;h choice Poetry, remarks on new Publications, and hiiloricai cxi-rifls an<i details. Such a woik, if executed with calmnefs and impartiality, it is evident, wouKi be boui a ufeiul and entertaining publication \\u2014 Several Genvlemen, who are of t!iis opinion, and who w.ih i'uch a fcheais cairicd inio cKccurioii, have fugge-!cd to tiie Editor, eiriierio pubiifh a Ur^^e /olume annually, or a Xmaller one haifyca.ly \\u2014 E;chcr way, tor fuch a work, there would ; c an abni\\\\daiice of ma;-trials, in an age when ever/ wetK, almod eveiy day, produces fomcthuig new and wonderful.

In the following paaes, two leading principle? are meant to be openly and'decidedly inculcated \\u2014 laniely, the importance of a religious and moral conduft ; and, the Ib'perior excellence of a Republicaa form ol Government. The KJitor thinks it right at once to difp'ay his colours, and avowedly to declare his lentiments \\u2014 in order, that thofe who expe^ tc^tin.l ot'ier principles in this book, by reading tbefe few lines, muy lave both their time and rbeir money.

A N EXPLANATORY and APOLOGETIGAt. PREFACE TO THE ALMANACK. L RINTERS and Pkinces have long been in thf hallt of fpeaking and writing in the imperative ftyle plural, as, we do tbit, WE ordei- that, and fo forth. If any of our Federal readers fliould be offended at the Printer preceding the Prince, let them recoiled, that this is, asyet, aRepublican country, and that both of them are often, very ofcen, mifchievous charaders. It is true, they don't much like fighting in their own proper perfons, but often, too often, they are the caufe of much blood being flied by others. Be it knov.n then to all the good people of this Commonwealth, that the Printer hereof v/ill'defcend from his imperative chair, and, for a little while, condefeend to talk like a common Citizen, in the f.rft perfon fnigular. When Urban 's .slmanack made its firft appearance, it naturally attracted the attention of all the Critics in that line of literature, and two grand faults were found with it, namely, that it had too much religion, and too little weather. \\u2014 To do the Sovereign People * julUce, there was fome truth in the firfl remark; the book was rather dull for a winter evening's amuie.nent; and however good the thing may be in itfelt, it is not right to cram religion down a man's throat whether he will \\u2022 \\\" Sovereign People\\\" 1 believe this very emphatical expreffion was firft made ufe of by that fuperior genius Mirabeau^ at the beginning of the French Revolution\\u2014 \\u2014Edmund Burke\\u00bb \\u2022when he faw things thro' another metlium, and got a penfion of 3 or 4oocl. a year, called the people \\\" the fwinifti multitude\\\" And Fenno, the compeer and fucceflbr of Porcupine, whilfl he was Printer to the Senate, and pnblilhed his libels within a few doors of their chamber, had the boldnefs to liken the Federal Government and the difterent States, to \\\" a fow with her farrow of pigs !\\\" Here was the liberty of the prefs with a vengeance \\u2014 Where was the Sedition Law then, or was it only Kiade to punilh the blackgaardilm of one Party ?- \\u2014 In London,, for an exprelfion half as grofs upon the King or Government, the Printer would foon have found himfeU' incloled wuhiu the ftrong walls cf Newgate.

FROM THE LIFE OF VOLTAIRE, TIRED of the lazy and fyci-phantic life vvLich I was obliged to lead at Paris, and meeting with a young lady who happ-tneti to think nearly as 1 did, In the year 1733^ we took the refolution to go and rj:jend iome years in the country, there, far irom the tninult and corruption of Courts, to culrivatcJier underflanding, and increafe her knowledge. This lady was the Marchionefs de Cliatelet, who, of all the women in France, had a mind the mofl capable of all the branches of Science. Her father, the Baron de Breteuil, had taught her Latin, which file underflood perfectly ; flie knew, by rote, the mofl beautiful pallages in Virgil, Horace, and Lucretius, and all the writings of Cicero were familiar to her. Seldom has there been united in tlio lame perfon, fo much jufhiels of difcernment and elegance of tafte, joined to fo ardent a deiire for information. At Cirev, on the borders of Champagne, we fought onlv inftruvSiion, and troubled not \\\"ourfelves >vith The follies of the world \\u2014 but, after having fpcnt fix years in our retreat, we were obliged to go to Biullels, where the family of the Ci.arelets liad long been embroiled in a law-luit with the family of the Honbrooks.

The world never, perhaps, btlield a father and Ton who lefs refembled each other than thefc two Monarchs. The father was an abfolnte Goth, a Vandal, \\\\vho thought of no other thing, during his whole re'gn, than amaflihg money, and maintaining, at the lealt pofTible expence, the finelt army in Europe. Never were rnhjcih poorer, or King more rich. He bought up, at a low price, the eflates of a ^^reat part oi his Nobility, wht) foon devoured the little money they got for them, mofl of which returned to thelloyal colFers by means of heavy taxes, All the King's lands were farmed out to tax-gatherers, who held the double office of Judge and Excifeman ; inlbnuich, that if a tenant did not pay on the very day appointed, he put on his [udge's robe, and condemned ti)c poor delinquent to pay double th.e fum.

I was conducted into his Majtfly's anartraent, in v.'hich I faw ivjihiiig but four bare walls. By the ligh: of a boujrie, i perceived a iraall truckle-bsd, in a fort of cloler, upon which lay a little thin man wrapped in a morning gown of blue cloth \\u2014 It was })ls Prufilan PJdjefty, who lay /leaking wiih a lit of the ague under a beggarly coverlet.

Whilft we were thus philofophizing upon liberty, the Miniirer Rambonet, mounted upon a poft-horfe| in his judrc's wig, was riding all night towards Liege, at the gates of which, neKt day, he pro* claimed, widi found of trumpet, rlie name of the King his mader, whiUt zooo foldicrs laid the cityj under contribution ! \\u2014 The pretext for this fine ex-: ploit was, certain rights which his Majcdy pretend'* cd to have over a part of the fuburbs. The drawing lip of the manifedo was committed to me, which! performed as well as the nature of the cafe would let me \\u2014 not lufpecSing that a King, with whom I had the honour of fupping, who called mc his dear friend, and who talked fo beautifully of natural joftice and the immortality of the foul, could pofiibly be in the wrong. The affair was foon brought to a conclufion ; the innocent people of Liege were oblig^; \\u00abd to pay a million of livrcs in hard calli, which more, tha\\u00ab VOLTAIFxE. 9 than defrayed his Majofty's expences caufed by his journey to fee iStraPourgli, ^'c I ibou felt ail attaciimeiu for him, as he had wit and an agreeable rt^anner, and, mortover, he was a King, which is a fedu(Stion fcldom vanquifiied by hunian weaknefs. Generally, autliors flatter Kinj;? ; but, in this inflance, I was praifed by a King ironi the crown of my head to the fole of my foot. Some time before ilie death of his father, the Prince had written againfi: the dctcltable principle* of Machiavel \\u2014 but this was before he becan^e aKino^, and whiHl his father gave him no great rtafon to admire defpotic power. This manufcnpt he had lent to rae at* Bruflels, to have il corrcv5ied and printed. With all my admiration for my kingly friend, I could not- help feeling fome remorfe at being concerned in printing this Anti-machlavelian book, at the very moment tiie Royal author, who had a iiundred millions in his cellars, was robbing the poor inhabitants of Liege of a million of livres I I began to perceive, that my kingly friend would not lh>p here. His father had left him 70,000 welldifciplined troops ; he was bufily augmenting them, and appeared to have a vaft inclination to give them employment the very iirft opportunity. In the month of Oclober 1740, the Emperor Charles VI. died of an indigeftion caufcd by eating ciiampignons, which brought on an apoplexy \\u2014 and this plate of champignons occafioned the death of many thou faPids of brave men, and changed the order of things in Europe, It was loon very evident, that the K.ing of PrufTia was not fo great an enemy to Machiavelifra as the Prince Royal! He had already afiembled his troops, yet none of his Minifters or Generals knew his defigns. I had fome reafon to fuppofe, that he meant to quarrel with France; as, three months before, he had fent to me a political diiTertation, written in his manner, wherein he confic'ered France as the natural enemy of Germany \\u2014 But it was conftitutional in Frederick 10 do the very reverfe of what he faid or wrote.

Elizabeth, it is faid, had a refemblance to her mother, the handfome Catherine, But, iffhe equalled her in thofe advantages which render the fv)cietv of women fo agreeable, (lie furpaffed her in the immoderate love of vicious plcal'u]\\\"e. Initead of having the art of commanding, like her mother, Elizabeth fubmitted herlelf to the guidance of others ; and this weaknefs was the primary caufe of the misfortunes of Peter III. That die might maintain her independence, El'zabeth refufcd to take a hufband, with whom llie muft have {Iiared the empire ; but Ihe did not the more ab- 24 CATIIEFaNE II. jbfbin from voluptuous gratifications ; and as, with her other ir.firmirics, Ihc had that of being a bigor, the Field Mariltal llazmiiouiky, her Grand Vencur, liad the art to pcrlbade her to give him her hand in a private manner.

Elizabeth, however, did not content heri'elf with one lover; Hie had frequent changes ; but Razumouiky permitted none to approach iier, except fuch as he thoui^ht to have too little underftanding, or ambition, to attempt a competition witii iiini. To her violent propenfity to voluptuonlnefs, Elizabeth added tirfl the love of good eating, and then the pleaiarcs of wine. Banquets, feaih, balls, mafqucradcs, and the moll frivolous amufcnicats, were preferred to bulinefs \\u2014 By degrees, flie proceeded from moderate cnjoymenrs to tlie extravagance of fenfualiiy; and her taile for devotion augmewted hir voluptuoafnefs, and added to the abfurdity of her character.

The youngeft of thele children was a gill, brought up under the name of Princefs Tarrakanoff.

Hosvever this be, he gained over the pcrfons to whom the education of this Princefs was committed, carried her oi\\u00a3y and conveyed her to Komc. Catherine, having intelligence of this tranfa<5lion, took immediate fteps to fru(hate the defigns of Prince Racizivil.

It now poircflcs every advantage that can be derived from a iea-porf, without its dangers; and, at tbe iame time, by means of its noble river, enjoys an extenlive communication with the internal parts of the country.

The names and actions of Peiopjdas and Epaminondas; of Leoni'Ja-: andAgis ; of tiarmodius and AriOogiton ; are familiar to every chihcal fcliolar, and have been long dear to mankind. In Rome, we behold one Brutus arifo to expel Tarqnin, and another to punifli Cselar. The burnrng liand of Scan'o^a appalled the heart of the king of Etifuria ; and a fcngle citir:cn, in the peribn of Horatius Codes, defending a bridge agamft a litrle army, flruck an aflonifhed enemy with terror and difmay. Similar caufes in Fi-nnce have produced nearly fi- , milar effects, and the triumplis of the r-/Ionarchy I'sve been already obliterated by the glorie? of the Republic. Diibrganiled, iindilciplined, dilfatisfied, her armies, at the beginning of the contefl, exhibited numbers without valour, and ensrerprife without fucceis. It can have been no comrooo principle, then BUONAPARTE. 77 then, that lias forced the veteran troops of Europe to tur/i _pale hc^ovc hcv freHi levies, and the Brunfv/icks, the Cierfayes, rlie Wurmlcrs, to lend their filvcr locks to men, new to the Icience of war, and unknown to hiftory. At one time we have i'een Du- Riouricr feeb-ly oppofing the allies, and a'5iuallv' deprecating their ellbrts ; at another time, invading their ])oficinons, and, foon afrer, flying to them for fncconr and protection. jourJan, by the exertion of foldieriy bravery alone, taught the enemy to refpc(^t his countrymen ; Pichcgru d;fplaved all the reiburces of a great tactician, and diredied every niovernent by the rul-rs of art. fvlorcan, in imitation of Xenoi>bon, acquired more glory by retreat, than others have achieved by viclory ; and Buonaparte, by uniting the w arrior and the Uatesman in his own perfon, has confummated tlie glory of his adopteU country. This extraordinary man, Buonaparte, was born Jn the town of Ajaccio, in Corfica, in 1767, is the ion of Ch.ar. Bjonaparic and LaetiriaRaniolini. His father, who was alfo a native Ajaccio, was bred to the law, at B.ome, and took part with the celebrated Paoli, in the me^vorable ftruggle made by a hau'lful of brave iflander?:, againfl the ryranniral efforts of Louig XV, and the Macliiavelian fthemes of his minider, Choilevil. 1 am aflt.u'cd, by a near relation of tl:c famil'/, that he not only Uiid afiOe t)ie jrown I'.pon this occafion, but a;?iuaiiy carried a ir-uiket as a private centinel. On the conq\\u00bb-,cri of the iAand, he v;if]icd to retire, \\\\\\\\'h\\\\\\\\ the galiint chieftain who had lo nobly ilruggled for its independence; but he Vv-as prevented by his uncle, a Canon, wlio exerciibd a parental autiioriiy over him. In 1773, a de}>t!tation from the three efla-es was fent to wait on the king of E'tance; and, on tins occafion, Charles Buonaparte was fcleCtcd to reprefent the Nobles. He was foon after promoted to the cfiice of Procuroioie Reale of Ajaccio, where his E z an- 73 BUONAPAKTH. anceHors, fuppofed to liave been originally fromTuC- caiiy, haJ been fettled nearly two liundrt;d years. The family of the el !cr Suvjnapajte was numerov.s, for he had fevtn children : four fon?, and ihree daughters. It was his good fortune, however, to be cherifhed by the French ; and both he and his family lived in the greeted intimacy witli M. dc Marboeuf, the Governor, wlio received a revenue o 60, ceo livres a year, on condition of doing noihing ! An Iiitendant w;;s paid nearly as much, and a (wai ni of hungry leeches, engendered in the corruption of the court of Verfailles, at one and the fame time Jacked the blood of the Corficans, and drained the treaflire of the mother country ; in fliort, like the conq'ieds of moje recent times, the fubjugation oC iLat illand I'eems to have been achieved for no oiher p-irpofe, than to graiify avarice, and fatiatc ra]-aci'^y. On the deat'i of his friend, Ch.arles Buonaparte,, M. dc Marboeuf continued to patronize his family,, and placed his fecond fon, Napolcone, the fubje6l of thefe memoirs, ax the Ecole Jdilita.'re, or Military A- caden'iy. The advantage refulting from Lhis leminary, which ha!^ produced more great men than any oilier in Europe, were not loi'i in ycnng Cuonaparte ;. he there applied himfelf wi-:h equal afnduity and add:efs to nia:aer::iatics, and Ituditd the art of war as a regular fcitnce. Born in the midil of a republican Itrurgle, in hii native land, it was his g(<od' f Ttune to ijurit into manhoc d, at the moment whenthe country of his choice flio k cff tie chains wltk \\\\vhich (he iiad been manacled for centuries. There wosallo fomething in his manners and habits that jinoiuKcd him eql.al to the fiiuation for which he ilenis U) have been deflined ; inftcad of imitating the frivolity of the age, his mind was continually oc cupied by ufeful ihidies ; aiul from the Lives of Plurarcb, a volume of which he always carried in, his pocket, he learned, at an early age, to co))y the. nianuers, and emulate the ai^lions, of antiquirv. With BUONAPARTE, 79 Whh This flifpofition, it is but litrle wonr^er tliat he ihould have d.dic:ircd liis liie to ihe profciilon of arms. Wc accordnigly Hnd him, wiule yet a boy, prelcn^iiig himfelf as a candidaie for a eommi(iiv)n in tne artillery ; and his iucceis equalled the expecUiiops of his friends, fur he was the iztiion tlje lilf, ont of tlie 36, who proved victorious in the contef!. In confeqnence of this event, he became a lieutenant in the French army, and fervcd as furh during TWO or three years, in the regiment of La Fe e. On the Ibcond expedition htied out againlt Sardinia, he embarked with his countrymen, and iai.iied in the little ifland of lYladd-tlena, which lie took polfvii^oa of, for the Fiench llcp\\\\iblic; but tinding ilje troops that i,ad been got logeiht-r for this eK]>edition iititucr pofrcilcd organization, nor dilciplinc, he rtitJiMed ro the port ol' Ajr cio, whence he had let out. In the mean time, a ii^lieme was forming iur the annexation of C'Mfi a to the crown of England ; and tiie cabitiet, in an evi' hryur^ acceded to a propofitjon wliich w'-ile it diminifned ihe wcahli, has contributed but lime either to the honour or advantage of t!at country. Bwonapp.'-te had a dimvult part to at^ wpon this o-calion ; he was perfonaily attached to Palquale Paoli ; he refented the treatment ho experienced ciurl -ijv the reign of the TerroriJ]s, and had at'^.ually drawn up, with hi? osvn band, the renionftriHue tianfmirted by the Mnnici; al:ty of /^jaccio agaiiu't tiie decree declaring the General an enemy to the Commonwealth. Indeed, he was fut^pofed 10 be io inrimarely connefled with him, that a warrant was a^lually ifTued bv Lacombe de St, Michel, and tl^e two other commiflioners of the Convention, to arreii young Baonaparte ! \\u2014 NotwithOanding this, he was d^'termined to remain faithful to his engagements, and learning that the Englidi fleet, in the Mediterranean, had failed for the pnrpofe of feizing his native ifland, he embarked, along svith his family, for the continent, and fettled wi*thin eighteen leagues of Ti)ulon. E 4 That So BUONAPARTE.

The conqiTefl of Toulon contribnted not a little (o ralfe the credit of Buonaparte ; and it proved tqudlly advantageous to his friend Barj'as. That deputy lidd been aifo bred a military rrjan, and was em]>loy-. cd by his colleagues on all great energies-.

Here a nev/ and a more dreadful enemy attempted to flop the progrefi of the conquerers. It was Superiiirion, clothed in cowls and furpiices, brandifhing a poniard in one hand, and a crucifix in the other ; but the fpeedy puniHiment of the prieds and other adherents put an end to the jnfnrrecliun, and thus laved Buonaparte and his arn^y from a more em.'neut danger than they had as yet experienced, and from which no French army that has hitherto crofled the Alps, has been exempt\\\". At lengti), Mantua, alone, remained in pofTelllon of the Auflrian:, and this alfo was foon inverted by the vi<5tors, who, at the fame time, made inroads Snro Tyrol, and, by the battle of Reveredo, and tlie pouellioQ of Trent, became mailers of the pafits tliat led to Vienna. . In BuONAP:^P.TE. 83 In the mean time, tlie gallant Wurmfer determined to fliut himfeU up, wicb the remainder of his dilpirited troops, in IVlantna ; and the Auflrians made one more grand effort, by means of GeneralAlvinzy, to refcue his befieged army, and regain their ancient preponderance in Italy. Bat the battle ot Areola completely difappointed their exve(51ations, and the capture of Mantua at one and the lame time concluded the campaign and their humiliation. In the winter of 1796, General Buonaparte was united to Madame Beauliarnois, a b^-autiful Frenchwoman, who had experienced a variety of perfccntions during the time of Robel'pierre. Her former hufband had atU'ned the rank of General in the fcrvice of the Pvcpuhlic, and had always condu5^ed himfelf as a friend of liberty. On that memorable day, w'len Louis XVI, and his familv, repaired to Paris, M. dc Beauharnois fat as prefident of the National AflTembly, exhibited great dignity of demeanor; notwithllanding this, he fell a victim to the Tcrrorifts, who, joining the narrow ideas of fc(5>ariils to the ferocious character peculiar to themfelves, pcriccuted all whole opinions were nctexavTtly cciiformable to their own flandard. M. Bar:as, at length, luckily for her, extended his protet^ion to the widow, who is now the wife of his friend. The campaign of 1797 opened under the moft anfpicious circumdanccs for France, as well as Spain, who was now in alliance with her ; Sardinia a^^ed a fubordinate part under her control ; Tuicany obeyed her requifitions ; Naples had concluded a fep arate peace, and Rome was at her mercy. In thir> fituation, the eyes of the Court of Vienna, and indeed of all Europe, were turned to the Archduke Charles, who was faid-to inherit tlie military talents of the Huufe of Lorraine. It was accordingly determined, that this young Prince Ihould be appointed Commander in Chief, and that the hero of Kehl should oppofe the hero of Italy.

As to his perfon, Buonaparte is of irnaii Itatiire^ but well proportioned ; he is of a f] are habit of bo\\u00ab dy, yet robuil, and calculated to undergo rf.e greateil fatigues. His complexion, like that of all the malts of loiuhren ciunatcs, is olive; his eves blue* bis chin p' onnnent, the lower parr of 1 i. face tkin, and his forehead Iquare and projecMinp; \\u2014 The wholeleni^th Italian pririt, publifnea in London bv Stflohrii^ exhibits a good likenefs ; but the beil portrait ever taken of him wa\\\"? at Verona, in ct)nlcquence of the felicitations of an Lnyl.fh artifl, who applied to him for this putpt>le, bv tr.eans of a leiier from London.

Tlie reproach is not i)ecu!iar to tiie Court of Turin, that, without courtly protection, nitrit makes but flow progiefs. How many Officers of talents have we beheld in obfcurity, whilfl tiie fon of a King;, or the baltard Ion of a Lord, has been lifted to high command and rich eniolumcnls ? \\u2014 It was well obferved by an Eiiplifh fubaltern, that, *\\u2022'\\u25a0 in order to attain a rapid prom<jtion in the Englifh r.?-my, he would rather be backed by a ro/U-/: borough than pr-ffofs the talents of a Turenne I\\\" MdiTcna became an Enlign in the Sardinian army, and an Enfiga he might have remained to this day, had he continued in that fervice. But another dcftiny awaited him; he threw up his commiHion, and entering into a French legion, his talents foon began to be dillingui/Jied. \\u2014 It was at the capture of Sofpellotliat he rirJt developed his m-litaiy talents, and it was entirely owing to him, that Saorgio, in tbe campaign of 1794, yielded to the French arms. For this important iervice he was made a General of Diviiion. When Buonaparte was appointed Com.mandcr in \\u2022 Chief in Italy, the local knowledge, the intrepidity, and military experience of MalTena, pointed him oi^t a? an Oiiicer every way capable of adding fuccefs to liis plans. A'.cordingly, we find him, in the fpring of i79^>7 adiing a brilliant part under the command of that wonderful Gener^iil, at the battles of Monte Lezina and Monte Notta, againfl tbe Sardinian arir,y, in which he had formerly ferved as an obfcure irdividual. \\u2014 He was alfo prefent at the battles of Dego, Millefimo, Mondovi, and Caflaria, in which he diltinguiflied himfelf by ihe Ikilful and impetuous val- MASSiilHA. 87 valour with which hw artacked the arniics unu'. r Proycyia, and iicaulieu.

There are, perhaps, few men better calculated always to triumph, and always to leave upon the other's mind, at lead, the juoil favourable impredions, if not the mofl decifive conviction. This is not diilicult to account for, when applied to Mr. Jeflerfon ; becaufe few men, like him, dcfcrves the application.

WlnHl v/e believe that m;)ny of the remarks made upon this portion of Mr. JefFerfon's Notes have come frosn pious and Nvell-meaning men, we mufl at the fame time obferve, that the groffeft and mofl illiberal lbi6lures have been made by others fiomfolitical and Jelfijh motives, as was fuliy evidenced pending the late election. \\u2014 It is thus that tiue Religion is diflionoured ; the fpiritua! affairs of the other world are dragged into the temporary concerns of this \\u2014 it is thus that Religion is thrown cut as a tub to ihe \\\\Thale, in oider to deceive and miflead the unthinking multitude I To that part of the extract which appears mofl objectionable, our Correfpondewt has fubjoined a note of obfervation, which we inlert verbatim.] EXTRACT from Mr. Jefferson's Notes. In anfwcr to the queflion, What religion is in the Hate of Virginia? \\u2014 Mr. JefFeribn proceeds thus : \\\" The prefent flate of our laws on the fubje6l of Religion is this. The Convention of May 1776, in their Declaration of Rights, declared it to be a truth, and a natural right, that the exercije of Religion Jhou-ld be free; but when they proceeded lo form on that declaration the ordinance of government, inftead of taking r.p every principle declared in the Ijill of Rigiits, and guarding it by legiflative fanction, they paffcd over that wliich afferted onr religious rights, leaving them as tl:ey found them. The fame Convention, however, when tl;ey met as a member of the general aiTembly in October 1776, repealed sU Avfls of Parliment wliich had rendered criminal the Mr, JEFFEllSONT. lot the maintaining any opinions in matters of religion, the forbearing to repair to church, and the exerciling any mode of worfliip ; and Ibfpended the laws giving laiaries to the Clergy, whicli iuipenfion was made perpetual in Oiitober 1779. Statutory opprellions in rciioion bcinp; thus wipt-d away, we remain at prell-nc under thofe only impofed by the common law, or by our own Acts of /iiiembly. Ai the common law, Herafy was a capital offence, puniiliable by burning. Its delinition was left to the eccleliafHcal judges, before wiioni the conviction was, till the Itatute of the 1 Eliz. c. i. circumfi-rlbsd it, by declaring, *' Tl at nothing Hioald be deemed H:refyi but wiiat had been fo determined by authority of the Canonical Scriptures, or by one of the four firf> General Councils, or by fome otlier Council having lor the grounds of their declaration the eiiprtfi aud plain words of the Scriptures.\\\" Hereiy, thus circamfciibed, being an oflence at the common laWy our a(5t of iifTembly of 1777, c. 17, gives cognizance of it to the General Court, by declaring, that the jurifdiction of that Court, ihall be general in ail matters at the common law. The execution is t>y the writ Dd H<:?retico canbtirendo. By our own ?-ii of Alfcmbly of 170.';, c. 30, if a ptrfon bcought up in the ChridJan religion denies the being of a God, or the Trinity, or allerts there are more Guds than one, or denies the Chriftian religion to be true, or the Scriptures to be of divine authority, he is punishable on the firfl olfence by incapacity to hold any cilice or employment ecclefialtical, civil, or military ; on the fecond by diiability to fue, to take any gift or legacy, to be guardian, executor, or adminiltraror, and by three years imprifonment, without bail.

The error feeins not fufiicienily eradicated, that the operaiioRS of the mind, as well as the acls of the body, are lubjed to the coercion of the laws. But our rulers can have authority over Ibth natural rights only as we have fubmitted to them. The rights of confcience we never iabmitted, we could not fubmit. \\\\Vc are anfwerable for tijem to our God. The legitimate powers of Governinent extend to I'uch aCis only as are injurious to others. But it does me no injury for my neighbour to fay, there are twenty Gods-, or no God ;'^' it ncith-cr picks my pocket nor breaks my leg. if it be faid^ his teliimony in a Court * It fometimes happens, that even the befl Writers, in their endeavours to eilablilli a fad, or iljullrate a principle, urge too much, and overfhoot their mark. \\u2014 With great deference to the higlily refpeAable Author of the Notes on Virginia, I think the above paiTage a proof of the remark \\u2014 nay more, it appears to nje a very objedionable one ; and I do not wonder at irs giving cf.ence to pious minds, and of being made the gr'ound-work of much cenfure and mifreprefentation, \\u2014 After the kncv.lcdge he now has of human nature, does T- r. Jeiierfon really think, that the man who believes in no God, is as good, or as uleful a member of fociety, as he ix^lo b<el!eves in one, or three, or twenty Gods ? \\u2014 Mr J. is too dignlfted a character to make a needlefs play npon words, of -* picking pockets, or of breaking legs \\u2014 but it may eaiily be imSigined, and experience confirms the fa\\u00abS, that the man who dilbelieves all Deity, and who has divefted himfelf of all mor^l and religious obligations, v/ould not only pick pcckes and break legs, but alfo commit theft and perpetrate murder, to gratify his greed or his revenge, i-f he could a\\u00a3l v.'idi impunity. \\u2014 What piudent man would entruit the honour of his wife, or his daughter, or his filler, or the care of his goods or his money, to the keeping of a profelfeJ Athieil, who is difengaged from every facred tie, who is afraid of no law but the pii^.ol or the gallows? \\u2014 I cc-uli fay much more on thi.3 fubjedl, IV r. Editor, if you would give me room \\u2014 but tlie pofition Is fo very plain and demonkrative, that it requires no ingenuity to fupport It \\u2014 1 therefore conclude with only remarking, that in a book which is fo ably and laudably calculated to vindicate and 11- Inftrate the ijoble principles of Civil and Religious Liberty, I am Mr. JEFFERSON. 103 Court of Juftlce cannot be relied on, reje(fl it then, and be the ftigma on him. Conltraint may make him worie by making hi:n a hypocrite, but it will never make him a truer man. It may fix him obliinately in his errors, but will not cure them. Real'on and free enquiry are the only eftedual agents agaiuil error. Give a loofe to tliem, they will fupport the true religion, by bringing every falCe one to their tribunal, to the tell of their invelHgarion. They are the natural enemies of error, and of error only. Had not the Roman government permitted free enquiry, Chriflianity could never have been introduced. Had not free enquiry been indulged, at the ?era of ihe Reformation, the corruptions of Chriihanity could not have been purged away. If it be retrained now, tlie prefeut corruptions will be protected, and new ones encouraged. Was the government to prefcribe to us our medicine and diet, our bodies would be in fuch keeping as our fouls are now. Thus in France tlie emetic was once forbidden as an article of medicine, and the potatoe as an article of food. Government is juft as infallible too when it iixes fydems in phyfics. Galileo was lent to the Inquifition for affirming that the earth was a {]\\\"\\u00bbliere : the government had declared it to be as fiat as a trencher, and Galileo was obliged to abjure his error. This error however at length prevailed, tlic earth became a globe, and Delcartes declared it was Avhirled round on its axis by a vortex. The government in which he lived was wiie enough to fee that this was no queltion of civil jurifdi^lion, or we fhould all have been involved by authority in vortices. In fa(St, the vortices have been exploded, and the Newtonian principle of gravitation is now more firmly ^abliihed, on the bafis ot Reafon, than it would be were the government to flep in, and to luake it an article of necelTary faith.

That tlicre Ihouki be cilTerences of opinion among our fellow-ciiizens, is to be expected always. IVlen who think freely, and have the right of expreiling their thoughts, will diifer. It is true that thefe dilfcrences have of late been artiHcially increaltd ; but th.ey are now again fubfiding to thtir natural level, and all will foon come right if no adis of violence intervene. The great quttlion which divides our citizens is, wlieiher it islafell that a preponderance of power fhould be lodged with the monarchical, or the republicaa branch of our Government r \\u2014 Temporary panics may produce advocates for the former opinion, even in this country ; but the opinion v.'iJl be as fhort-lived as the panic with tlie great mafs of our fellow-citizens. There is one circumdance which will ahvays bring them to rights: a preponderance of the executive over the Icgifiative brancli cannot be maintained but by immcnfe patronage, by ir.ultiplying offices, making them very lucrative, by armies, liavies; &c, which may enlill on the fide of the Mr. JEFFERSON. 105 the patron all thofe whom he can inrerefb, and all their families and connexions ; but tkei'e expenccs mui\\\\ be paid by the bbcuring citizen ; he ccinaot loni^ continue, therefore, the advocate of opinions, whicli, to fay only the leafl of them, doom the labouring Citizen to toil and fweat tor ulelefs pageants. *' I Hiould be unfaithful to my own feelings were I not to fay, that it has been the grcatcfi- of ail human confolatioiis to mc, to be confidcred by the republican portion of my fellow-citizens as the fafe dcpolitary of their rights.

When that is loit, all experience has fiicwn, that no forms can keep them free againft their own will.

Aaron Burr was born at Fairfield ; he was educated at Princeton College, New Jerfey, of which ieminary his father was Prefident. In the year 1775, when be was at the age of 25, he was made Aid de Camp to General Putnam, and dillingniOied himftlf in fo eminent a manner as an able Officer, that he wasfelicSled by General Waihicgton to be Lieu. Col. of cne of the 12 additional Regiments. Tnrou*rh the whole of the war, he was djftin^ruifhed by the fame ardent devotion to the principles of Liberty, the fame courage and judgement, which mark liis character at this day, F 5 At ic6 * Mr. BURR. At the ren:ora!:ion of peace, having cxhaufted an ample patriinony in the fervice of his Country, Mr. Burr found himfelf compelled to the profefTion of the Law as the means of fubfillcnce. Here, not with- \\\" finadiag the conjpetition of Mr. Hamilton and otlaer gentlemen of great talents in New York, he foon obtained an high reputation ; and the rapid fortune he ' acquired from an exisnfive pradlice, declared the favourable opinion of his fellow citizens. PoflcfTed once more of an independent fortune, he forfook the . troublefome occupation of an Advocate, for one more fuited to his inclination, and better adapted to the difplay of his talents. He entered the Legiflature of New York, then became a Senator of the U. States, and in both places he was equally refpe^lable and always patriotic. Endowed with a mind firm, liberal, and comprehenlive, America can claim but few citizens as fit as Mr. Burr to be placed as a fecond in the government of the country. With an energy and decifion ot character peculiar to himfelf, while orher men are debating, he refolves j while they think, lie a(5ls. \\u2014 His manners are amiable, his reputation unblemifh-'' cd. He has overthrown the dangerous influence of Foreigners intheflate of New York; and, in conjunction with his highly refpetTlable compeer Mr. Jeiferfon, it is hoped, that they will banifti it from the national councils altogether, leaving A)nerica to be governed by its own Citizens. \\u2014 In (horr, Mr. Burr isanunifurm, conHilent, tried Republican, We conclude this lliort account of Mr. Burr, with giving a place to the following extract of a letter 'written by hiin ro a Member of Congrefs, when he learned that it was probable the votes would be equal for Mr. Jeifcribn and himfelf, in order to convince Cono^rel's in particular, andAraerica in general, that he difclaimed all idea of contefting the pofl of honour with that Gentleman. \\u2014 The letter retle(Sts much credit on Mr. Burr, and muft raife him (fill higher in the eftimation of his fellow citizens.

There is one circiimftance which leads us to hope, that Congrei's commences ivs proceedings in the new Cai)ital at via aufpicinus period. \\u2014The unfortunate difleieiices wliich have too long fubfifted between the French and American Repu.hlics, are, we triiH, nearly terminated; and that iLc t^i-o countrler,, fitted by their forms of government, to be on rmicable terms, will henceforth he on terms of concord and harmony. \\u2014 Wirh refpcct to tlie nature of the Treaty, no one v;lU imagir.e, that the American Envoys, either from particdity or prejudice, will have conferred any advantages on France, not divflated by a [crupulous adherence to the prlnc iples of a jujl reciprocity. The fenvimenrs they are known to poiVefr,, and their high refpeclability and integrity, are AifTiciont pledges of their upright cov.dud.

The money expended en thefe objecls, it is well known, arifes to a very large amount, and the property thus acquired by the government:, and which is now oa hatid, cannot be efclmated, on the moft moderate calculations, at a fum lefs than four millions of dollars. The value of this property mig)it be ccnlidtred as ccm- ])ofnig another item in the credit of the general account of debt, but the Commirtee have not thought it necefiaij- to include it, arid have noticed it particularly at this time, for the purpoie of exhibiting a more general view of the extraordinary expence incurred by the govcrnment.and for the purpofe prtfcnting all that information, in relation to the debt, which will enable th^ Houfe accurately to appreciate the great and increafing relburces of the country; and on this point the committee cannot forbear to remark, that the progvefs of tiic government, in its financial operations, muit aftbrd the moll flattering prefages of its future fucccfs, if the fani3 fyitem is purfued. which has liitherto proved 10 fuccefsful. \\\"It cannot certainly be unworthy of remark that ten years have not at this time elapied fince the government fairly commenced its operations ; that during that period it has been necefiary to liquidate, to fund and to provide for a large capital of floating debt which has grown out of the difoideirs of tiie Confederation; that during the fame iliort period, the government has been compelled to concend with one expenlive war on the frontier, with two infuvre\\u00bbftions in tiic centre of our country, and with depredation and hoitiliiy from the naLions of Europe ; that thefe embarraJfuients have neverthelcfs .been faced by tlie government ; moft of the ciifficulcies have been furmounted; the debt has been liquidated and dlminilhed, and the nation has flill continued to increafe in we?Ji'n and population beyond all former example ; and although the conteft in which we are now engaged, may, for a {hr.n period, retard the further extingaiftimeut of debt, or perha],)s produce a fmall addition to that which al-. ready exiils, yet it cannot be doubted, that v;hilif we retain order at home, no exterior circnmitances can .e::hauft or greatly diminifh the increafmg refources of the nation.\\\" We have thus impartially flated, as far as our limits will, allow, the diiierent fums at the ditFerent periods, as rc])refented by the Commiitee.

Copy c.r a Letter from Mr. WesTj the celebrated Americaa Artift in -London, to Mr. King the American Minifter at the British Court, on the fubjeft of a Monument to hz eiecTted to ihe Memory of Geneial Wasliii'gton, SIR, London, ^\\u25a0E\\u25a0.y 25, 1800, Observing the Ri^ohitions paiVcd by the UniteJ States of America, for removing the boc'y of George Washington from the family vti'lt to the city bearing his name, and their intentien to iaifs an app-apviate monument to his memory in that city, I tho\\u00bb'ig-ht the foilowinj^ obfervatlor.i,, witli the ])!an for a monur.icvit, from me as an /.merican and one not altogether cbfcure in the elegant arts, might }}e acceptable to thole in that country, who are deiircus of paying the lafl tj ibute to his memory, by a monumental record, ];laced-:n the Federal City. The raifmg of monuments to departed virtue, has ever ce\\u00abn an objert of the firil attention in all civilized countries, ard ne people ever had fo prcud an inftance in doing this as the Americans, by rpifing one to true x'iitue and r^al worth, as that v.'hich pr^fents irfelf to them in the charaAer of General Wafliington, an'd that the _ placing of fixh records in public fiU'.ations has ever been coniidered trtie policy, by all vv-iie governments, for v/hich the highways, fquares and circufes for i'uch records have been preferred, v.'e have the highcil authority froin tiie Egyptians, Grecians, and Romans. \\u2014 That tiie raiur.g of a monument to rhe memory of General Waihir.gton, I believe, is the wiili of all the civilized world. I do therefore recommend, that the mioftdirabi^ form for Inch a norument be a^PJited, whicli is, that of the Triaiigle or Pyram>id, and that Tts fituation be the moil coufpicuons in the Federal City ; ifs height one hundred and lifty feet, and its bans the fame. The place or fquare, where it is erefted, to be planted with trees to give inviting shade, and to be opened to the public: this will atTord the parent or tutor an oppovtunity to incr.lcate the vir':ues of that great man, in the juvenile mind of the riling cifipring. Thie infide of the pyramid has a conic cavity to fave the cxpence in building, and at the farnc time gives as rristch rtvengt^i rs tliough folid; within that is built a roturdo, lighted from the top, in which is placed the pcdeilrian ilaue ct the General in bronze, to be in height not lets than feven feet, and round the rotundo eight balio-relievos in the fame metal, four containing mSll'rary, and four civil fubjects. in pl?xe of the frize and dado rvund the rorundo, a grove to be cut, to a considerable depth, and in the fame m.annev round the eight baifo-reljevos. This will give a monumental fimtjlicity, which belongs to its cha^a^ier, and tr\\u00bbe whole cf the ipari> men!\\\" to lie ific natural cflonr of the ilone with wnicn u ts buil;i one -of tiie four eritiancea into tiie rorundo to be clqmj., for WASmNGT027*s MAUSOLEUM. 145 ^nr the place where the remains of that j^-eat mnri should depoflied in a Hone coffin, which should be elevated, and p.dcr it a pioper inlcription. The three entrances which \\u25a0id into ihe rotundo, to ha^'e iron j;p.tes, to be opened on xed days, for feeing; the fepnlchre. Such a rnonnment v/ou!d be an aj^propriate one to the exalted charadler of C;eorp;c \\\"Washington, and worthy t>.e United Stages of A- \\u2022 ..rica to raife to his meriory. It shcnlcl ftaiid })re-eminefl\\u00ab; 1 magnitude, as tht; chararier it records flood ]<re eminent in v.rtue. as well as to give a taile to any monuments that Tnay in future be e-^xfie.d \\u2014 it will both adoni ilie City, and infpire the people wi*h virtue from genera; lc:i to ^^eneration, for thoufands of years.

Altho' every one knows what a dollar is, yet, fev/, very few, compiehend the fi'.ni of 80 millions of dollars, and therefore f'.rm very imperfeol ideas of the vveight and magnitude of the National Debt. \\u2014 A dollar weighs 17 dv.-ts ni.e 3-4 grs. Troy weight ; and 80 millions of dollars would weigh 2090 tons 1125 lbs. aver-du-poifc weight. Now if waggons were employed to carry So miillions of dollars, at a ton a ,load, and the waggons four rods afunder, they would occupy the fpace of 26 miles and i-8th. Pretty well for a Government not yet 21 years of age ! The National Debt of England is fully 500 millions fteH. about 2000 millions of dollars, but this debt began in King William's time.

It is believed, that no public docnnienis illuC- tiative of public trjuifadicus, however intereiHng, were ever more generally read or thoroughly a])proved, thanthefe were ; ncr can if be doubted that the light which they communicated on the very important rubie(f> to which they referred, tended to incioare in a high degree, the conhdencc of the good peocle cf this Commcnwealrh, in the wifdom and rcflitude of the pel icy which governed the General Affeinbly. In connedion with that fubjcft it is proper to add, that fnice your lafl. Si^fiion, the Sedition Law, one of the Avis complained of, has beea carried into efieel iri this Conimonwealrh, by tha decifian of a Federal Court. \\u2014 I notice this event, not v^i;h ^ view of cenluring, or even criticirnv; it. The tranfaftion has gone to the world, and the impartla'.will judge of it, as it deferves. I notice it iov the purpofe of remarking, th^it the decifion w;vs executed with the fame order. and tranquil fubmiffion ou the part of the people, as could have been ihevrn by them on a fimliar occafion to any the moll neceil'\\u00abtry, conftltutional, and popular AtHs of the Government. The conilitutional authorities and the good people of this Cr>mmonv/ealth, are at- ached to the U- nion, and cheriih it with their fondeft. wiilies. The cclonization of their anceftors in this VVcilern world, was generally from the fame country, at the fame time, and produced by the fame cauie ; they alike groaned under an oppreffion v.'hich reprefied their growth and checked their profperity : \\u2014 they fought and bled in the fame battles, in defence of the fame rights, and have hnce experienced, with unexampled harm' ny ajid unanimiiv, a variety of new and intcrefting cccunenc: s which ad-.n^jniia them,they iljl) arc and ought to remain forever united. The General AlTen-bly, anU the g^od pcO|de of ti^is Commonwealth, have aciiuittcd thcra- H 5 ftives T54 VirvGINIA. ieives to their own cor.iciences, and to their brethren in America, in Aippcrt of a cuule, which they deemed a na\\u00abr tjonal^one, by the Hand they ir-ade, and the i'entiments theyexprelTed of thofe afts of ths General Government; hue they have looked for a char.3;e in that refpecl, to a change in the public opinion which ought to be free, not to meafuresof violence, difcord and difunion, v/hich they abhor.\\\" \\u2014 \\\" Some time in April hft I vv-as advifed by a refpectabla citizen in Norfolk, that a Magiurate of that Borough had received fror^.i the Captain oi the Confiellation, a frigate of tae Uiiited Srates.a perfon faid to be one of the mutineers on board hir, Britannic i\\\\ ajeily's fhip the Hermione ; that he committed the faid perfon to jail, with an order to the jailor to furrender hinri to the Britlili Conful, on his application; that he was furrendered accordingly to the faid conful, who fent him to a Britifn Inand where he v/as executed. A conduct fo extraordhiary as that alledged, could not otherwife than excite the a'tonifhrnent of the Execurive. Evcrv man within the jjrifdiction of the ftate, is under ceiiain excejitiuus, amenable to its laws and eniitled to its protection. If he comnmlts an offence agaiiift the foverelgnty, or other rights of the United States, he is amenable to their government and iav/s fcr the infraction But the act v.dnch was denounced did not appear to proceed from, or to be fanctioned by the authority of that government. T'o dcfignate a man within the jurifdiction of a fiate, as one not entitled to its protection, or that of tlie United States, to diveft him of fuch protection, and furrender him to a t'?reign power, to be fent abroad, tried, condemned, and execired, by tiie fenterice of a foreign trii>unal, are important acts of ibvereignty, in which th\\u00ab character and agency of the chief public functionaries {h^ould be feen and for which they are highly refponfible, Evt nothin?' of the kind appeared in the prcfent inilance. No relpectfi.l, though llrict analylis, by the competent authcrity, of the refpective claims to jurisdiction, betv^esn the itate and the Linitecl Stjites, with refpect to the fugitive, who iought an afylum here; no circumfpedl examination of treaties between theUnitedStates and a foreign power, y-hich ou*>lit to pvrcede an act derogating in fon.e refpetts from the na'-i -ral fovereignty, were heard of The rnagifhale who acted was net t\\\\en an officer of the federal government, but of this fiate, in which ligiit, he was in a peculiar degree refponfable to its autjiority. The act was ftated to be fu:rmary and peremptory, and ftrictly that of the magiilrate himf'^lf. As ho-wever this communication compromitted tlie cbaracter of a cci iul of a foreign power, and an olticer of the United States, as veil as tiai of anagi- I'^rate of this Comrron wealth, the Executive v.' as carefwl t^ obierve in the part it took, the utmcll deference to the rights ^ of VIRGINIA. 155 o\\u00a3 thofe who were to be afteaed by it. The information was given in writinj^ by a rcfpeftahle citizen, but yet that did not feem to be un evidence fufticiently formal and authentic, to juftify a prompt proceeding under it. It was deemed more confiftent with the principles of juftice,_ and becoming the charaAer of a free State.to caufe the verity of thefe charges to be afcertained by attidavit, with due notice to the parties before any Hep was taken. And as the Attorney General war. neceilarily engaged in public bufinefs in one of the fiiperior courts at the time, that truft was committed to George Hay, a citizen of merit and talents, by \\u2022whom it wao executed, with that degi-ee of judgement and propriety its delicacy and irrportance required. 1 am forry to add tkat the refult of the enquiry did not diminifh the pvefumption that the charges alledged were true. It was deemed of fafficient force to impoie en the Ejvccutive an obligation, to refer the fubjefl to the Attorney General, with a reciieil that he would take fuch meafure s in reference to the tranfavElion as in his judgement might be fui table. I fuhniit a copy of all the papers neceifary to give a full view of this intereiling occurrence to the General Afiembly ; with whofe wifdcm it will remain to determine, wh.ether any further provilicn ought to be made by law for fimilar offences in future,\\\" Copy of Mr. Lee's Letter, referred to in Governor Monroe's ^ddrefs to the Legillature : SIR, \\u2014 Without apology for my not baling perfoually know n to you, I take the liberty of addreiTmg to ycu as chief magiilrate of the Coirimonweakh of Virginia, on a AmjeA ;n my judgement highly intereiling to the liberty and happinefs of my fcUovz-cirizens, Some time in the fpring of laft year, Cap/ain Truxton,of the Cnnileriation frigate, fent to Uoclor J. K. Read, one of the aldenr.en of the borough of Norfolk, a man wiio he faid had acknowledged hlmielf one of the mutiiieers on board the Kerraione fiigaie; the man was committed to jail, fubjedl to the order of tl^e Britifn conful, by iilm taken cut, fent to Jamaica, and tiiere e.'iecuted. Tliis information is from Dr. Read himi\\\"e!f, in the prefence of ieih Foiler, J. Nivifon, OtwayByrd, Dr. Uarraud, the Britifli Conful and feveral othei's ; for on being alked by cap*. Tnruttion on tunday laft, what had become of the man he had fent as one of the mutinfcvs onboard of the Hermione frij;are, he replied that he had delivered him to the Britifh conful. Mr Hamilton, who was prefenr, obferved, he had fent him to Jamaica, where he was hanged, .-lihough this co'-.fef^cn was made in the ];re fence of Haunch federal ills ^nd men of order, yet the principle was alarming, and of ccuife made fonie noife 1^6 VIRGINIA. noife. As foon as I heard of it I aj;plied to the jailer. The refuit of ray enquiry is, that there was fuch a T)erfon committed by Doctor Read, fubject to the order of the BritiihCoaful ; that he was taken out of jail, and put on beard of a BritiHi veird \\u2014 but what his fate v.- as, he knows not. \\u2014 The mittii-rius he fays is either loft or millaid. Tke jailor r.lfo informed nie, that previous to this another man was committed by D(ticrllead for the fame ofTence, but that he died in jailbefcre there was an oj)jiortunity to fend him away; a copy of this mittimus I herewith fend you. I fhall forbear to remaik on the dieadful confeqi'ences that may arife from a cor.ducl of this fort, and fliall only obfei-ve, that if men cloathed wiih authority can be made inllruments cf opprefiion to gratify the views of a Britilh Conful, we may bid adieu to the liberty and happinefs cf ouv coimtry, and every thing dear and valuable to us in it.

THE fubjoined letter was written by me to Governor Monroe, and went to the hope, that his Excellency, fenfilile of the injury he muft have done ir.e, in his letter of ccmmunicaticn to the legillature, would have thought it right, to reqiieil a rufpeniion of the public opinion, until the event of that prcfecution which he has ordered againlt m.e, and which is dependi:.g and 'undettnn'mcd, fliculd be known. But, his Excellency has neither dei^aed to notice my letter, or to tr.ke any meafures for foftening the feverity of hiu denunciation, is It not noveiry in the ?j(\\u00b0\\u00abophilofophy?

The proceaure complained of, was vyaaton, becaufe, as no legiilative interference could pc:libly affect me, for a iuppcfed oft-ence hereUifore committed, and as you have honoured me with executive, I can by no means become the objecl of legiilative attention ; therefore, no valuable purpole, could refult, fromconfigningme, to the execration and refentment cf my feilow-chizens at large, by a cc:mnnunicaiion thus highly lanaioned, u)ilefs indeed, it was calculated 10 poifon and iniluence the public mind, to the develiilion of that imparl laliy, v^hich ihould be the firft feature in the event of every legal procefs.

The necelfitics of Europe have more thari doubled the price ; and altho' it be certairJy a fact that the clearing cf new grounds augments the quantity of produce, that augmentation bears no prcporatiou to the difference of value piefented by the tables for three years back fent in frcm the diSerent Cuilomhoufes.\\\" The Duke, after giving a curious account of his unpleafant voyage from Charleftcwn in a fniall, encumber'd veirtli, proceeds to defcribe Norfolk, &,c. \\u2014 \\u2022' Norfolk is built on Elizabeth-River, at nine miles frcm the fpot where it difcharges its waters into the bay. In the i.itervcning fpace there are fewhoufes, and thcfe few aimolt 2.1] preient a wretched apjeararice. An aimolt ur.iiiterrupted fucceiEcn cf pines are tlie only objeft Vv-hich meets the voyagers eye. Crar.ey Illand lies nearly in the middle of the river at a (hort dlAance above its n;cuth. Two points of land, which rpproach within a quarter oF a mile of each cther in front tf !. 01 folk, are flrengtheiied wiih forts whicli. tre capable of fiiccefsfuUy defending the entrance. That on the Norfolk fide is in better condition than the ether, which, hov/ever, might be fpeedily repaired, at no great expence. \\\"Portfmouth, a linall aflemblage cf houfes on the opDoCtie f.de of the river, did not ihare in the conflagration cf Norfolk. From its fituation it feem.ed entitled to expe<S all the commerce of Elizabeth-Kiver : at its quays the greateft depth cf water is found: at the higheli tides, it is there 12 feet deep, whereas it is only 6 at Norfolk; the pump-wafer at the former place is net brackilh, a\\u00bb at the latter; the foil on which the town is built is more dry, and the air more falubrious. But, ac the conalufion of the peace, the inhabitants incenfcd againft the Englifh, refiifed to admit any merchant of that nation, or any new-comei whole political principles were liable to fufpicion. To this rancorous difpolition was attributed a political motive of a leis generous kind \\u2014 an apprehtinhon on the part cf the American m.erchants NORFOLS:. .^183 ^hants who had remained at Fortfmoiith, left the new traders who came to fettle among them, fhould, by the advantage of bringing in greater cai)itals than they themfelves poiVeiied, be enabled to outdo them in the line of commerce. \\\"; 'owever this m:\\\\) be, th^ coniequences has been, that the inhabitants have removed to the oppoiite fide ; that Norfolk has been rebuilt, aad that its trade is twenty times more confiderable than that of Portfmouth ; nay.the fev/ merchants who ftill refide in the latter town, purchafe at Norfolk almolt E.I1 the articles that conilitme their cargoes, and fonic of them even have their compting-houfes there. \\\" At the clofe of the year 1783, there were not 12 houfes rebuilt in Norfolk; at prefent (1796) there are between 7 and 800. It is one of the uglieft, moft irregular, and moft iilthy towns that can auy where be found. The houfes are low and unfighdy, almofl all conflrafled of wood, and ereiTted without any attention to regularity ; not ao \\u00ab>f them arc built with brick. The llreets ar\\u00ab unpaved ; the town h furrounded by fvvamps ; the naitinefs and ftencii which prevail are exceluvc, and add to the natural infalubrity of tiic fiuiation, and of the climate, which is extremely hot. \\\" Frpm thefe concurrent fources of unheahhinefs, it refalts, that difeaies are liabitual at Norfolk in f.mimer and autumn, and tliat malignant ej)idemics are frequent. Laft year the Yellov/ Fever is faid to have carried oiT 500 perfons from a popula;iou of 4000; 300 died at the time liie diftcmpcr prevailed, the others fell victims to its coniejiience.s, \\u2014 The inhabitants of Xorf/lk, even thofc among them who arc the moft opulent, fancy that the ufe of wine and ftrontliquors furnifnes theci with a prefervative a?ainft the infalubrity of the climate, and they make a li'jeral ufe of the remedy. \\u2014 Previous to the war, Norfolk is faid to have contained 8&C0 inhabitants. \\\" Norfolk carries on a confiderable trade with Europ'-, the Anrilles, and the northern States. Her exports are rtour] Avheat, Indian corn, timber of every kind, particularly planks, ftaves, and fningles, fait meat and tifh, iron, lead, tlax-feed, tobacco, tar, turpentine, and hemp. AW thefe articles are the produce of Virginia, or of North Carolina, which latter State, having no fea-ports, or none that are good, makes her exportatioas chiefly thro' thofe of Virginia. \\\" Norfolk is the only port for the foutliern part of this extenfive State ; for, as no vefiels above 120 tons can go up to Peterft>urg or Richmond*, the produce of the back conntrs', which is brought to thofe places by land, is for the moft part fent * Here the noble Duke has been miftnformcd \\u2014 Any vefftil drawing lef; than 17 feet water may come up JamesRiver to City Point, the delivering-place for Petersburg; and theri is 12 feet water at Rockets, the Undiag-place for Richmoiid. i84 NOtlFOLK. fent clo\\\\V-!i in lighters to Norfolk, from whence it is exported. Tlius, this port alraoil fmgly carries on all the commence ci that part of Virginia v/hich lies fouth of the Rappahannock, and of North Carolina far beyond the Roanoke. \\\" Ten years ago, Norfolk cov-ld not reckon ten large veffels of her own ; whereas at prefent (lie pofic^lfes fifty of that defcription, exclufive of fifty others of fmaller fize employed in the Weft India trade. Under the name Norfolk, are to be underilood Norfolk and Fcrtfraouth, as they conftitute hue one jjort of entry, and are both fubjecfl to the fame Cuftom-houfe. \\u2014 The prefent tonnage of Norfolk is 15,567 tons, exclulive of the vef^els employed in the coafling trade. *' The exportation of Tobacco from Norfolk has, by the diminwtion of the culture of that article in Virginia, been rtKluced above one third within the lail five years. In 1793, it amounted to 15,000 hhds. \\u2014 in 1794, to 11,054 \\u2014 and, in ^795> *^\\u00b0 9>9^^ hhds. I have net been able to procure an accurate f^atement of the quantities in 1791 and 92.\\\" (At prefent we m.ufl conclude our extracts from this work. It is not written in tliat lively, vivacious flyle which generally diftinguifh French, authors, but this may be ov/ing to the Tranflator ; and, as may expeded, the Duke fometimes writes with the partiality of a Frenchman, particularly when \\u2022 he fi:)eaks of England or Englife men. \\u2014 Upon the whole, how^ever, we recommend this Book to the perufal of all Americans, and among them the good people of Virginia ; it contains many articles worthy of their moll ferious attention. \\u2014 Do Vv'C willi to hiow onrsehes, will we con iult only thofe who are partial to us ? \\u2014 If we defire to have a right knowledge of our own characlers, and to know what really are our faults and imperfedions, let us confult llrangers and. tiiofe vrho are not partial to us \\u2014 it is fometimes even neceffary to liRen to the remarks of our enemies. \\u2014 We do not mean to intimate, that the Due de I..iancourt is an enemy to America; on the contrary, he fpeaks with eileem and gratitude yf the hofpitable reception which he received in almoil every part of the Union.)

During their imprifonment.withoat any ether inilrument thaii a pen-knife, they have fabricated a machine of cedar wood which difcovers the Perpetual Motion.

Daring the conteft of opinion thvo' which we have paft, the animation of difcuflions and of exertions, has fometimes worn an afpecTt which might impofe on llvan^ers unufed to think freely, and to fpeak and to write wl^ at they thinkbut this being now decided by the voice of the nation, announced according to the rules of the Conftitution, all will of courfe arrange themfelv^s under the will of tiie Law, and so6 PRESIDENT'S SPEECH. unite in common efforts for the common good. All too wHi bear in mind this facred principle, that tho' the will of the majority is in all cafes to prevail, thatwijl, to be rigktfiri, muft be reafonablc ; that the minority polTefa their eqml rights, which equal laws muft proteft, and to violate would he oppi-efiion. Let us then, Fellow Cihv^ens, unite with one heart and one mind, let us rcfiore to focJal intcrcourfe that harmony and afTedtion without which liberty, and even life itfelf, are but dreaiy things. And let us reiiedl, that having baniuiedfrom our land tliat religious irAolerance under which mankind fo long bled and fuSered, we have yet gained iitde, if we countenance a political intolerance, as defpotic, as v/icked, and capable of as bitter and bloody periecutions. During the throes and convulfions of the ancient world, during tlie agonifing fpaiVn 5 of infuriated nu-m, icekiiig thro* blood and daughter his long-loft liberry, ir v/as not wondci-- ful, that the agitation of the billows ihould reach even this dlftant and peaceful fncre ; that tliis fnculd be more felt and feared by feme and kis by others; and ftiould divide opinions as to meafurcs of fafety ; but every difference of oiv.niou is not a difference of jjrinciple. We have called by dilferent names brethren of the fame principle. We are all Republkans : ice are all Federalists. If there be any among us ivho v/ould wiih to diffolve this Union, or to change its republican form, let them ftand undifturbed as monuments of the fafety with which error of opinion ma/ be tolerated, where reafon is left free to combat ir. I know indeed that fome honeft m.en fear that a republican government cannot be ftrong ; that this government is not ftrong enough. But would the honeft patriot, in the full tide of fuccefsful experiment, abandon a government which has fo far kept us free and fmn, on the theoretic and vifionary fear, that this government, the world's beft hcpe, may, by pcIEbility, v/ant energy topreferve iticlf ? \\u2014 I truft not. I believe this, on the contrary, the ftrongeft government on earth. I believe it the only one, where every man, at the call of the law, would flyto the ftandai-d of the law, and would meet invafions of the public order as his own perfonal concern. \\u2014 Sometimes it is faid that man cannot be trufted with the government of himi'eif. Can he then be irufted with the governmeur of others ? Or have v;e found angels, in the form of kings, to goveni him? \\u2014 Let hiftory anfvver this queftion. Let us then, with courage and confidence, purfue our own federal and republican principles ; our attachment to Union ar/d reprefentative Government. Kindly feparated by nature and a wide ocean from the exterminating havoc of one qrarter of the globe ; too high minded to endure the degi-adations of the others, poflefling a chofen country, with room enough for our defcendants to the'houfandth and dioufandth generation, entertaining a due fenfc of our equal right to the PRESIDENT'S SPEECH. afoy uCc of our own faculties, to the acquifitions of our own intliiftry, to honor and confiderxe from our Fellow Citizens, rciulting- not from birth, but fiom cur adiions and their fenfe of them, enlightened by a ben).g;n religion, profcCed indeed and pi-a\\u00ab5lifed in various forms, > et all of them inculcating; honcity, truth, tempf-rance, gratitude, and the love of man, acknowledging av.d adoring an over-ruling rrovidence,whicU by all its difpcnfations proves that it delights- in the bappinefs of man here, and his greater happiuefs hereafter ; with all thcrcblellings, what more is neccirary to riake us a happy y-nd a profperous people ? \\u2014 ttiU cne thing more, Fellow Ci-. tizens, a wife and frugal government, which fnall rcliraiu men from injuring one anotlicr, finall leave them otherwife free to regulate their own purfuits of induftry and improvement, and Ihail not take from the. mcuth of labor the bread it has earned. This is the fum of good government ; and this is necefiary to clofe tlie circle of cur felicities. About to enter, Fellow Citizens, on the e,\\\\ercife of duties Vvhich comprehend every thing dear and valuable to you, it is proper you fhould undtrfiand vvhat I deem the eflential principles of our Government, and confequemly thofe which ought to flvape its adminiilration. I will comjn-efs them ivitliin the narroweil ccmpafs they will bear, Hating the gejieral principle, but not all its limitations. \\u2014 Equal and exacl j-uilice to all men, of whatever (late or perfua'ion, religious or political: \\u2014 peace, commerce, and honeil friendfhip with all nations, entangling alliances v/ith none r-^\\u2014the fupport of the State governments in all their rights, as tire moil competent adminillrations for ourdomeilic concerns, and the fureft .bulwarks againft anti-republican tendencies : \\u2014 the prefervation of the general government in its whole conuitutional vigor, as tlic facet anchor of peace at home, and fafety abroad : \\u2014 a jealous care of the right of election by the people, a mild and fafe corrective of abufes which are lopped by the fword. of revolution v/here peaceable remedies are unprovided : \\u2014 abfolute acquiefcence in the dtcifions of the majority, the vital principle of Republics, from v. hich is no ap- .pcal but to force, the vital principle and immediate parent of defpotifm ; \\u2014 a well difciplined militia, our bell reliance in peace, and for the f ril n^oments of war, till regulars may 'relieve them : \\u2014 the fupremacy of the civil over the military authority: \\u2014 economy in the public expence, that labour may .be lightly burtheued :\\u2014 the honeil payment of our debts and facred prefervation of the public faith : \\u2014 encouragement of agriculture, and of commerce as its handmaid: \\u2014 the diifufion of information, and an-aignment of all abufes at the bar of the public reafon : \\u2014 freedom of religion ; freedom of the prefs ; and freedom of perfon, ur.der tne prote^don of the Habeas Corpxis : \\u2014 aiifl trial by juries impartially felecTted. Thcfe principles form the briglit cciuUUation, winch has goite before us, and, guided our iltps throuj^li an age of revolution in<a/ reformation. The wifdom of our fages, and bloodof our lieroes, have been devoted to their attainment : \\u2014 they fnould be the creed. or our political faith ; the text of civic inftrucliou, the toucnftone by which to try the fervices of thoie we truft ; and fi:.oiild we wander from them in moments of error or of alarm, let us hailen to retrace our Heps, and to regain the road which alane leads to peace, liberty, and fafety. I repair then, Fellow Citizens, to the poft you have affigned me. With experience enough in fubordinate offices to have fecn the diffiCi.lties of this the greateft of ail, I have learnt to e.xped that it will rarely fall to the lot of imperfeft man to retire from this flation with the reputation, and thefavor, which bring him into it. Wiihoutpreteniions to that high confidence you repoied in our Erft and greateft revolutionary Charafter, whcfe pre-eminent fervices had entitled him to the firft place in his country's love, and deilined for him the faireft page in the volume of faithful hiftory, I aik\\\" fo much confidence only as may give finnneis and effect to the legal adminiftration of your affairs. I H-.all often go wrong through defect of judgment. When right, I friall often be thought wrong by thoie whofe portions will not com* maud a view of the v/hole ground. I afk your indulgence for my own errors, which v,-!!! never be intentional ; and your liipport againfh the errors of others, wlio may condemn what they would not if ittn in all its parts. The approbation im* plied by your fuffrage, is a great confolation to me for the pall ; and my future fclicitude will be, to retain the good opinion of thofe v/ho have beftowed it in advance, to conci\\\" Hate that of others by doing them all the good in my power^ and to be mftrumental to the happinefs and freedom of all. Relying then on the patronage of your good will, I ad^ vance with obedience to the work, ready to retire from it whenever you become fenfible hov^r much better choices it is in your power to make. And may that iniinite Power, which rules tiiC deftinies of the univerfe, lead our councils to what is beft, and give them a favorable iiTae for your peace and profperity, C N.
